The executive in organization is in an entirely different position. In his situation there are four major realities over which he has essentially no control. Every one of them is built into organization and into the executive’s day and work. He has no choice but to “cooperate with the inevitable.” But every one of these realities exerts pressure toward nonresults and nonperformance. 1. The executive’s time tends to belong to everybody else. If one attempted to define an “executive” operationally (that is, through his activities) one would have to define him as a captive of the organization.

If the executive lets the flow of events determine what he does, what he works on, and what he takes seriously, he will fritter himself away “operating.” He may be an excellent man. But he is certain to waste his knowledge and ability and to throw away what little effectiveness he might have achieved. What the executive needs are criteria which enable him to work on the truly important, that is, on contributions and results, even though the criteria are not found in the flow of events.

4. Finally, the executive is within an organization. Every executive, whether his organization is a business or a research laboratory, a government agency, a large university, or the air force, sees the inside—the organization—as close and immediate reality. He sees the outside only through thick and distorting lenses, if at all. What goes on outside is usually not even known firsthand. It is received through an organizational filter of reports, that is, in an already predigested and highly abstract form that imposes organizational criteria of relevance on the outside reality.

All societies used to be poor. Most are now lifting out of it; why are others stuck? The answer is traps. Poverty is not intrinsically a trap, otherwise we would all still be poor. Think, for a moment, of development as chutes and ladders. In the modern world of globalization there are some fabulous ladders; most societies are using them. But there are also some chutes, and some societies have hit them. The countries at the bottom are an unlucky minority, but they are stuck.

As for the forms our trackers use? They’re also marvels of data gathering. They have evolved constantly over the three decades we’ve been doing this research and are, without a doubt, the key to the entire enterprise, a great achievement, if I may say so, in the art of information storage and retrieval, nondigital division. We have tried scanning systems, exotic software packages…and we keep going back to the same old system. It works, it’s flexible, and thanks to Wite-Out and a copy machine, it can be changed on a dime and on the fly. Our ability to react to what and whom we find walking through the door of wherever location we go is critical to our success. I’d guess that at least one third of the time we go on location, we end up finding something very different than what our client told us we’d find. The store has six aisles and not seven, the shelf layout has been mysteriously reversed or that interactive machine we were hired to study arrived at the store nearly a month ago and hasn’t worked since.

Our earliest track sheets were able to record maybe ten different variables of shopper behavior. Today we’re up to around forty. The form is reinvented for every research project we undertake, but typically it starts with a detailed map depicting the premises we’re about to study, whether it’s a store, a bank branch, a parking lot (for a drive-thru project) or just a single section—even just one aisle—of a store. The map shows every doorway and aisle, every display, every shelf and rack and table and counter. Also on the form is space for information about the shopper (sex, race, estimate of age, description of attire) and what he or she does in the store. Using the system of shorthand notation we’ve developed over the years, a combination of symbols, letters and hash marks, a tracker can record, for instance, that a bald, bearded man in a red sweater and blue jeans entered a department store on a Saturday at 11:07 a.m., walked directly to a first-floor display of wallets, picked up or otherwise touched a total of twelve of them, checked the price tag on four, then chose one, and moved at 11:16 to a nearby tie rack, stroked seven ties, read the contents tags on all seven, read the price on two, then bought none and went directly to the cashier to pay. Oh, wait, he paused for a moment at a mannequin and examined the price tag on the jacket it wore. We’d mark that down, too, just as we’d note that he (the man, not the mannequin) entered the cashier line at 11:23 and exited the store at 11:30. Depending on the size of the store and the length of the typical shopper’s stay, a tracker can study up to fifty shoppers a day. Usually we’ll have several trackers at a site, and a single project may involve the simultaneous study of three or four locations. For huge stores like a home improvement center or a mass merchandiser, we may put ten or twelve trackers on the floor.

The list of particulars we’re capable of studying—what we call the “deliverables”—grows with every new project we take on. At last count, we’ve measured close to a thousand different aspects of shopper-store interaction. As a result of all that, we know quite a few facts about how human beings behave in stores. We can tell you how many males who take jeans into the fitting room will buy them compared to how many females will (65 percent to 25 percent). We can tell you how many people in an IBM employee cafeteria read the nutritional information on a bag of corn chips before buying (18 percent) compared to those lunching at Subway (2 percent). Or how many browsers actually buy computers on a Saturday before noon (4 percent) as opposed to after five p.m. (21 percent). Or how many shoppers in a mall housewares store use shopping baskets (8 percent), and how many of those who take baskets actually buy something (75 percent) compared to those who buy without using baskets (34 percent). And then, of course, we draw on all we’ve learned in the past to suggest ways of increasing the number of shoppers who take baskets, for the science of shopping is, if it is anything, a highly practical discipline concerned with using research, comparison and analysis to make stores and products more amenable to shoppers.

For example, we discovered a phenomenon that journalists love to report—what’s become known as the “butt-brush” effect—completely as the result of a happy accident. As part of a department store study, we trained a video camera on one of the main ground-floor entrances, and the lens just happened also to take in a rack of neckties positioned near the entrance, on a main aisle. While reviewing the tape to study how shoppers negotiated the doorway during busy times, we began to notice something weird about the tie rack. Shoppers would approach it, stop, and shop until they were bumped once or twice by people heading into or out of the store. After a few such jostles, most of the shoppers would move out of the way, abandoning their search for neckwear. We watched this over and over until it seemed clear that shoppers—women especially, though it was also true of men, to a lesser extent—don’t like being brushed or touched from behind. They’ll even move away from merchandise they’re interested in to avoid it. When we checked with our client, we learned that sales from that tie rack were lower than they expected from a fixture located on a main thoroughfare. The butt-brush factor, we surmised, was why that rack was an underperformer.

I make much of the accidental nature of the science of shopping, and perhaps it’s because this all began almost by accident when I was a student and admirer of one of America’s most esteemed social scientists, William H. Whyte, author of such highly influential books as The Organization Man, The Last Landscape, City: Rediscovering the Center and The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces. He was also the founder, in 1974, of the Project for Public Spaces, or PPS, which still exists and is still a magnificent contribution to the preservation and ongoing good health of the urban landscape.

What all that means is that fewer buying decisions are being influenced outside the premises of the store. And many more of those decisions are being made in the store itself. It means that shoppers are susceptible to impressions and information they acquire inside stores, rather than relying on brand-name loyalty or advertising or marketing to influence what they buy. The level of impulse purchasing is going through the roof—in supermarkets and everywhere else, too. Even big decisions are being made right there on the selling floor.

Finally, our studies prove that in general, the longer a shopper remains in a store, the more he or she will buy. And the amount of time a shopper spends in a store depends on how comfortable and enjoyable the experience is. Just as Holly Whyte’s labors improved urban parks and plazas, the science of shopping creates better retail environments—ultimately, I would argue we’re providing a form of consumer advocacy that benefits our clients as well.

I soon learned that there is no “effective personality.” * The effective executives I have seen differ widely in their temperaments and their abilities, in what they do and how they do it, in their personalities, their knowledge, their interests—in fact in almost everything that distinguishes human beings. All they have in common is the ability to get the right things done. Among the effective executives I have known and worked with, there are extroverts and aloof, retiring men, some even morbidly shy. Some are eccentrics, others painfully correct conformists. Some are fat and some are lean. Some are worriers, some are relaxed. Some drink quite heavily, others are total abstainers. Some are men of great charm and warmth, some have no more personality than a frozen mackerel. There are a few men among them who would answer to the popular conception of a “leader.” But equally there are colorless men who would attract no attention in a crowd. Some are scholars and serious students, others almost unlettered. Some have broad interests, others know nothing except their own narrow area and care for little else. Some of the men are self-centered, if not indeed selfish. But there are also some who are generous of heart and mind. There are men who live only for their work and others whose main interests lie outside—in community work, in their church, in the study of Chinese poetry, or in modern music. Among the effective executives I have met, there are people who use logic and analysis and others who rely mainly on perception and intuition. There are men who make decisions easily and men who suffer agonies every time they have to move. Effective executives, in other words, differ as widely as physicians, high-school teachers, or violinists. They differ as widely as do ineffectual ones, are indeed indistinguishable from ineffectual executives in type, personality, and talents. What all these effective executives have in common is the practices that make effective whatever they have and whatever they are. And these practices are the same, whether the effective executive works in a business or in a government agency, as hospital administrator, or as university dean.

Effectiveness, in other words, is a habit; that is, a complex of practices. And practices can always be learned. Practices are simple, deceptively so; even a seven-year-old has no difficulty in understanding a practice. But practices are always exceedingly hard to do well. They have to be acquired, as we all learn the multiplication table; that is, repeated ad nauseam until “6 x 6 = 36” has become unthinking, conditioned reflex, and firmly ingrained habit. Practices one learns by practicing and practicing and practicing again.

These are essentially five such practices—five such habits of the mind that have to be acquired to be an effective executive: 1. Effective executives know where their time goes. They work systematically at managing the little of their time that can be brought under their control. 2. Effective executives focus on outward contribution. They gear their efforts to results rather than to work. They start out with the question, “What results are expected of me?” rather than with the work to be done, let alone with its techniques and tools. 3. Effective executives build on strengths—their own strengths, the strengths of their superiors, colleagues, and subordinates; and on the strengths in the situation, that is, on what they can do. They do not build on weakness. They do not start out with the things they cannot do. 4. Effective executives concentrate on the few major areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results. They force themselves to set priorities and stay with their priority decisions. They know that they have no choice but to do first things first—and second things not at all. The alternative is to get nothing done. 5. Effective executives, finally, make effective decisions. They know that this is, above all, a matter of system—of the right steps in the right sequence. They know that an effective decision is always a judgment based on “dissenting opinions” rather than on “consensus on the facts.” And they know that to make many decisions fast means to make the wrong decisions. What is needed are few, but fundamental, decisions. What is needed is the right strategy rather than razzle-dazzle tactics.

  Management literature has long known the theorem of “the span of control,” which asserts that one man can manage only a few people if these people have to come together in their own work (that is, for instance, an accountant, a sales manager, and a manufacturing man, all three of whom have to work with each other to get any results). On the other hand, managers of chain stores in different cities do not have to work with each other, so that any number could conceivably report to one regional vice-president without violating the principle of the “span of control.” Whether this theorem is valid or not, there is little doubt that the more people have to work together, the more time will be spent on “interacting” rather than on work and accomplishment.

  Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., former head of General Motors, the world’s largest manufacturing company, was reported never to make a personnel decision the first time it came up. He made a tentative judgment, and even that took several hours as a rule. Then, a few days or weeks later, he tackled the question again, as if he had never worked on it before. Only when he came up with the same name two or three times in a row was he willing to go ahead. Sloan had a deserved reputation for the “winners” he picked. But when asked about his secret, he is reported to have said: “No secret—I have simply accepted that the first name I come up with is likely to be the wrong name—and I therefore retrace the whole process of thought and analysis a few times before I act.” Yet Sloan was far from a patient man.

A good many effective executives keep such a log continuously and look at it regularly every month. At a minimum, effective executives have the log run on themselves for three to four weeks at a stretch twice a year or so, on a regular schedule. After each such sample, they rethink and rework their schedule. But six months later, they invariably find that they have “drifted” into wasting their time on trivia. Time-use does improve with practice. But only constant efforts at managing time can prevent drifting. Systematic time management is therefore the next step. One has to find the nonproductive, time-wasting activities and get rid of them if one possibly can. This requires asking oneself a number of diagnostic questions.

CONSOLIDATING “DISCRETIONARY TIME” The executive who records and analyzes his time and then attempts to manage it can determine how much he has for his important tasks. How much time is there that is “discretionary,” that is, available for the big tasks that will really make a contribution? It is not going to be a great deal, no matter how ruthlessly the executive prunes time-wasters.   One of the most accomplished time managers I have ever met was the president of a big bank with whom I worked for two years on top-management structure. I saw him once a month for two years. My appointment was always for an hour and a half. The president was always prepared for the sessions—and I soon learned to do my homework too. There was never more than one item on the agenda. But when I had been in there for an hour and twenty minutes, the president would turn to me and say, “Mr. Drucker, I believe you’d better sum up now and outline what we should do next.” And an hour and thirty minutes after I had been ushered into his office, he was at the door shaking my hand and saying good-by.

One does not get to the point where one understands what one is talking about.” During the hour and a half I was in his office every month, there was never a telephone call, and his secretary never stuck her head in the door to announce that an important man wanted to see him urgently. One day I asked him about this. He said, “My secretary has strict instructions not to put anyone through except the President of the United States and my wife.

If deprived of performance in any one of these areas, it will decay and die. All three therefore have to be built into the contribution of every executive.

The conflict between what we’re told we feel and what we really feel may be the richest source of confusion, dissatisfaction, and unnecessary suffering of our time. The answers normally proffered don’t answer the questions at the heart of our erotic lives: why are men and women so different in our desires, fantasies, responses, and sexual behavior? Why are we betraying and divorcing each other at ever increasing rates when not opting out of marriage entirely? Why the pandemic spread of single-parent families? Why does the passion evaporate from so many marriages so quickly? What causes the death of desire?

One of the most cited studies in all of evolutionary psychology, published by 1989, is typical of the genre.9 An attractive undergraduate student volunteer walked up to an unsuspecting student of the opposite sex (who was alone) on the campus of Florida State University and said, “Hi, I’ve been noticing you around town lately, and I find you very attractive. Would you go to bed with me tonight?” About 75 percent of the young men said yes. Many of those who didn’t asked for a “rain check.” But not one of the women approached by these attractive strangers accepted the offer. Case closed. Seriously, this study really is one of the best known in all of EP. Researchers reference it to establish that women aren’t interested in casual sex, which is important if your theory posits that women instinctively barter sex to get things from men. After all, if they’re giving it away for free, the bottom falls out of the market, and other women are going to have a harder time exchanging sex for anything of value.

As mentioned above, underlying each of these theories, as well as evolutionary theory in general, is the notion that life can be conceptualized in terms of economics and game theory. The objective of the game is to send your genetic code into the future by producing the maximum possible number of offspring who survive and reproduce. Whether or not this dispersal leads to happiness is irrelevant. In his best-selling survey of EP, The Moral Animal, Robert Wright puts it succinctly, saying: “We are built to be effective animals, not happy ones. (Of course, we’re designed to pursue happiness; and the attainment of Darwinian goals—sex, status, and so on—often brings happiness, at least for a while.) Still, the frequent absence of happiness is what keeps us pursuing it, and thus makes us productive.”10

Chimps and bonobos are practically neighbors, living within thirty miles of each other in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and York-town Heights, New York. Both just fifty miles from New York, they are well within commuting distance of humanity. Gorillas are enjoying cheese-steaks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Table 1: Social Organization Among Apes7 Bonobo Egalitarian and peaceful, bonobo communities are maintained primarily through social bonding between females, although females bond with males as well. Male status derives from the mother. Bonds between son and mother are lifelong. Multimale-multifemale mating. Chimpanzee The bonds between males are strongest and lead to constantly shifting male coalitions. Females move through overlapping ranges within territory patrolled by males, but don’t form strong bonds with other females or any particular male.Multimale-multifemale mating. Human By far the most diverse social species among the primates, there is plentiful evidence of all types of socio-sexual bonding, cooperation, and competition among contemporary humans. Multimale-multifemale mating.* Gorilla Generally, a single dominant male (the so-called “Silverback”) occupies a range for his family unit composed of several females and young. Adolescent males are forced out of the group as they reach sexual maturity. Strongest social bonds are between the male and adult females.Polygynous mating. Orangutan Orangutans are solitary and show little bonding of any kind. Male orangutans do not tolerate each other’s presence. An adult male establishes a large territory where several females live. Each has her own range. Mating is dispersed, infrequent and often violent. Gibbon Gibbons establish nuclear family units; each couple maintains a territory from which other pairs are excluded. Mating is monogamous. * Unless you’re sticking with the standard model, in which case humans are classified as monogamous or polygynous, depending on the source.

Anthropologists Stephen Beckerman and Paul Valentine explain, “Pregnancy is viewed as a matter of degree, not clearly distinguished from gestation … all sexually active women are a little pregnant. Over time … semen accumulates in the womb, a fetus is formed, further acts of intercourse follow, and additional semen causes the fetus to grow more.”2 Were a woman to stop having sex when her periods stopped, people in these cultures believe the fetus would stop developing. This understanding of how semen forms a child leads to some mighty interesting conclusions regarding “responsible” sexual behavior. Like mothers everywhere, a woman from these societies is eager to give her child every possible advantage in life. To this end, she’ll typically seek out sex with an assortment of men. She’ll solicit “contributions” from the best hunters, the best storytellers, the funniest, the kindest, the best-looking, the strongest, and so on—in the hopes her child will literally absorb the essence of each.

Many otherwise reasonable people seem to have a burning need to locate the roots of war deep in our primal past, to see self-sufficient foragers as poor, and to spread the misbegotten gospel that three or four decades was a ripe old age for a human being in pre-agricultural times. But this vision of our past is demonstrably false. ¿Que pasa? If prehistoric life was a perpetual struggle that ended in early death, if ours is a species motivated almost exclusively by self-interest, if war is an ancient, biologically embedded tendency, then one can soothingly argue, as Steven Pinker does, that things are getting better all the time—that, in his Panglossian view, “we are probably living in the most peaceful moment of our species’ time on Earth.” That would be encouraging news, indeed, which is what most audiences want to hear, after all. We all want to believe things are getting better, that our species is learning, growing, and prospering. Who refuses congratulations for having the good sense to be alive here and now? But just as “patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it” (G. B. Shaw), the notion that we live in our species’ “most peaceful moment” is as intellectually baseless as it is emotionally comforting. Journalist Louis Menand noted how science can fulfill a conservative, essentially political function by providing “an explanation for the way things are that does not threaten the way things are.” “Why,” he asks rhetorically, “should someone feel unhappy or engage in anti-social behavior when that person is living in the freest and most prosperous nation on Earth? It can’t be the system!”23 What’s your problem? Everything’s just fine. Life’s great and getting better! Less war! Longer life! New and improved human existence!

Or maybe just the women. When it comes to sex, men may be trash-talking sprinters, but it’s the women who win all the marathons. Any marriage counselor will tell you the most common sex-related complaint women make about men is that they are too quick and too direct. Meanwhile, men’s most frequent sex-related gripe about women is that they take too damned long to get warmed up. After an orgasm, a woman may be anticipating a dozen more. A female body in motion tends to stay in motion. But men come and go. For them, the curtain falls quickly and the mind turns to unrelated matters. This symmetry of dual disappointment illustrates the almost comical incompatibility between men’s and women’s sexual response in the context of monogamous mating. You have to wonder: if men and women evolved together in sexually monogamous couples for millions of years, how did we end up being so incompatible? It’s as if we’ve been sitting down to dinner together, millennium after millennium, but half of us can’t help wolfing everything down in a few frantic, sloppy minutes, while the other half are still setting the table and lighting candles.

Psychologist Richard Lippa teamed up with the BBC to survey over 200,000 people of all ages from all over the world concerning the strength of their sex drive and how it affects their desires.13 He found the same inversion of male and female sexuality: for men, both gay and straight, higher sex drive increases the specificity of their sexual desire. In other words, a straight guy with a higher sex drive tends to be more focused on women, while higher sex drive in a gay guy makes him more intent on men. But with women—at least nominally straight women—the opposite occurs: the higher her sex drive, the more likely she’ll be attracted to men and women. Lesbians showed the same pattern as men: a higher sex drive means more women-only focus. Perhaps this explains why nearly twice as many women as men consider themselves bisexual, while only half as many consider themselves to be exclusively gay.

The options most men see before them seem to be: 1. Lie and try not to get caught. While this option may be the most commonly chosen, it may also be the worst. How many men think they have an “unspoken agreement” with their wife that, as long as she doesn’t find out about it, it’s okay for him to have a casual relationship on the side? This is like saying you have an unspoken agreement with the police that it’s okay to drive drunk—as long as they don’t catch you. Even if there is some understanding along these lines, any lawyer will tell you that unspoken agreements are the worst possible foundation for any long-term partnership. Gentlemen, you are going to get caught sooner or later (probably sooner). You have as much chance of getting away with this as a dog has of following a cat up a tree. Ain’t gonna happen. One reason: most women’s sense of smell is significantly better than most men’s, so there’s probably going to be evidence you can’t even sense, but that she’ll pick up on. Need we even mention the much-vaunted powers of female intuition? This requires you to lie to your partner in life. To deceive the mother of your children, the person you were hoping to grow old with. Is this really who you are? Is this the man she chose to share her life with? 2. Give up on having sex with anyone other than your wife for the rest of your life. Maybe resort to porn and Prozac. Antidepressants are the most prescribed drug in the United States, with 118 million prescriptions written in 2005 alone. One of the most prominent side effects of these drugs is the dampening of libido, so maybe the whole issue will just fade away—chemical castration. If not, there’s always Viagra, with well over a billion tablets doled out in the decade since it was introduced in 1998. But Viagra creates blood flow, not desire. Now men can fake sexual interest too. Progress? It’s not the same, is it? And isn’t there something humiliating (not to say emasculating) about sneaking off at night to look at porn on your computer? This course often leads to serious anger and resentment that can destroy a relationship. 3. Serial monogamy: divorce and start over. This option seems to be the “honest” approach recommended by most experts—including many relationship counselors. Serial monogamy is a symptomatic response to the issues posed by the conflict between what society dictates and what biology demands. It solves nothing in terms of snowballing male (and thus, female) sexual frustration in long-term sexually monogamous relationships. Though often presented as the honorable response to the conundrum, the serial monogamy cop-out has led directly to the current epidemic of broken homes and single-parent families. How is it “adult” to inflict emotional trauma on our children because we’re unable to face the truth about sex? Susan Squire, author of I Don’t: A Contrarian History of Marriage, asks: “Why does society consider it more moral for you to break up a marriage, go through a divorce, disrupt your children’s lives maybe forever, just to be able to fuck someone with whom the fucking is going to get just as boring as it was with the first person before long?”34 A man who pursues long-term happiness by leaving behind a string of hurt, embittered women and emotionally wounded children is little more than a dog chasing tail—his own. And if you’re a woman whose husband is “cheating,” your options are no better: pretend you don’t notice what’s going on, go out and have your own revenge affair (even if you don’t feel like it), or destroy your own family and marriage by calling in the lawyers. These are all losing scenarios.

I’d realized that whether in poker, in business, or in life, it was easy to get caught up and engrossed in what I was currently doing, and that made it easy to forget that I always had the option to change tables. Psychologically, it’s hard because of all the inertia to overcome. Without conscious and deliberate effort, inertia always wins. I’d started to force myself to think again about what I was trying to get out of life. I asked myself what I was trying to accomplish, what I wanted to do, and whether I should be sitting at a different table. From my poker experience, I knew it was never too late to change tables.

They were expensive lessons, but I guess what I ended up learning was that it’s a bad idea to invest in industries you don’t understand, in companies you don’t have any control or influence over, or in people you don’t know or trust. Over time, I also kept asking myself why I was investing in anything at all. What was my goal? To make more money? That didn’t make sense, since I had already given up a lot of money when I walked away from Microsoft.

I realized that the day-trading and investing I was doing weren’t really fulfilling. I didn’t feel like I was really building anything. It felt more like I was gambling, but with the odds stacked against me because I was investing money in things I didn’t understand. I ultimately made the decision to pull out of almost all my stock market investments and to try to figure out something more meaningful to focus on instead. I had been checking in every week or two with the folks at Zappos, offering advice (especially on the technology side) as needed. It was just a handful of people working at Zappos, but they were making good progress for such a small team.

A few months earlier, I’d reconnected with some friends from high school, and similar to my college days, a core group of about fifteen of us formed and we started hanging out with each other several times a week. In the beginning, it wasn’t purposeful or planned. It was just a by-product of the fact that there were already so many of us living in the same building, so impromptu gatherings became more and more common. Sometimes we would hang out in someone’s loft, and other times we would all plan on going to a nightclub or rave together. Slowly, we grew our community, and our building became the hub for not only our own friends but also friends of our friends. Without realizing it, we’d created and developed our own tribe, and the most common meeting point became the loft that I lived in. As our group grew, I realized that forming new friendships and deepening the connections within our burgeoning tribe was bringing both a sense of stability and a sense of excitement about the future for all of us. The connectedness we felt was making all of us happier, and we realized that it was something that we had all missed from our college days. It was something that, like many people, we had unwittingly lost upon graduating from college, and we didn’t realize how much we missed it until we accidentally recreated it for ourselves. I made a note to myself to make sure I never lost sight of the value of a tribe where people truly felt connected and cared about the well-being of one another. To me, connectedness—the number and depth of my relationships—was an important element of my happiness, and I was grateful for our tribe. The purpose of my big birthday party coming up wasn’t actually meant to focus on me. My birthday was just the excuse. The party I had been planning for months was going to be my gift to the tribe.

Outsourcing that to a third party and trusting that they would care about our customers as much as we would was one of our biggest mistakes.

At Zappos, an additional step is required: a photo of a randomly selected employee is displayed, and the user is given a multiple-choice test to name that employee. Afterward, the profile and bio of that employee are shown, so that everyone can learn more about each other. Although there is no penalty for giving the wrong answer, we do keep a record of everyone’s score. Internally, we refer to this as “The Face Game.”

Perceived Control In our call center, we used to give raises once a year to our reps, which they didn’t really have any control over. We later decided to implement a “skill sets” system instead. We have about twenty different skill sets (analogous to merit badges in the Boy Scouts), with a small bump in pay associated with each of the skill sets. It’s up to each individual rep to decide whether to get trained and certified on each of the skill sets. If someone chooses not to get any, then he or she simply stays at the same pay level. If someone is ambitious and wants to gain all twenty skill sets, then we let the rep decide on the right pace to achieve that. We’ve since found that our call center reps are much happier being in control of their pay and which skill sets to attain.

Our misery that afternoon, in which the smell of tears mixed with the scents of sun cream and air conditioning, was a reminder of the rigid, unforgiving logic to which human moods appear to be subject, a logic that we ignore at our peril when we encounter a picture of a beautiful land and imagine that happiness must naturally accompany such magnificence. Our capacity to draw happiness from aesthetic objects or material goods in fact seems critically dependent on our first satisfying a more important range of emotional or psychological needs, among them the need for understanding, for love, expression and respect. Thus we will not enjoy—we are not able to enjoy—sumptuous tropical gardens and attractive wooden beach huts when a relationship to which we are committed abruptly reveals itself to be suffused with incomprehension and resentment.

Of all modes of transport, the train is perhaps the best aid to thought. The views have none of the potential monotony of those on a ship or a plane, moving quickly enough for us not to get exasperated but slowly enough to allow us to identify objects. They offer us brief, inspiring glimpses into private domains, letting us see a woman at the precise moment when she takes a cup from a shelf in her kitchen, then carrying us on to a patio where a man is sleeping and then to a park where a child is catching a ball thrown by a figure we cannot see. On a journey across flat country, I think with a rare lack of inhibition about the death of my father, about an essay I am writing on Stendhal and about a mistrust that has arisen between two friends. Every time my mind goes blank, having hit on a difficult idea, the flow of consciousness is assisted by the possibility of looking out the window, locking on to object and following it for a few seconds, until a new coil of thought is ready to form and can unravel without pressure. At the end of hours of train-dreaming, we may feel we have been returned to ourselves—that is, brought back into contact with emotions and ideas of importance to us. It is not necessarily at home that we best encounter our true selves. The furniture insists that we cannot change because it does not; the domestic setting keeps us tethered to the person we are in ordinary life, who may not be who we essentially are. Hotel rooms offer us a similar opportunity to escape our habits of mind. Lying in bed in a hotel, the room quiet except for the occasional swooshing of an elevator in the innards of the building, we can draw a line under what preceded our arrival; we can overfly great and ignored stretches of our experience and reflect upon our lives from a height we could not have reached in the midst of our everyday business. We may be subtly assisted in this endeavour by the unfamiliar world around us—by the small wrapped soaps on the edge of the basin, by the gallery of miniature bottles in the minibar, by the room-service menu with its promises of all-night dining and by the view onto an unknown city stirring silently twenty-five floors below us.

No one finds such things odd; no one says anything.' And in Flaubert's eyes, they were right not to. Central to Flaubert's philosophy was the belief that humans were not simply spiritual creatures but also pissing and shitting ones, and that we should integrate the ramifications of this blunt idea into our view of the world. ‘I can't believe that man's body composed as it is of mud and shit and equipped with instincts lower than those of the pig or the crab louse, contains anything pure and immaterial,' he told Ernest Chevalier.

I want to know what they do, where they're from, their names, what they're thinking about at that moment, what they regret, what they hope for, whom they've loved, what they dream of… and if they happen to be women (especially youngish ones), then the urge becomes intense. How quickly you would want to see that one naked, admit it, and naked through to her heart. How you try to learn where she's coming from, where she's going, why she's here and not elsewhere!

Flaubert's lifelong relationship with Egypt seems like an invitation to deepen and respect our own attraction to certain countries. From his adolescence onwards, Flaubert insisted that he was not French. His hatred of his nation and its people was so profound as to make a mockery of his civil status. Hence he proposed a new method for ascribing nationality: not according to the country of a person's birth or ancestral origins, but instead according to the places to which he or she was attracted. (It was only logical for him to extend this more flexible concept of identity to gender and species, and consequently to declare on occasion that contrary to appearances, he was in truth a woman, a camel and a bear: ‘I want to buy myself a beautiful bear—a painting of one, that is—frame it and hang it in my bedroom, with Portrait of Gustave Flaubert written beneath it, to suggest my moral disposition and social habits,' he announced.)

Sunlight shone through the pink-and-grey plastic-coated curtains, and traffic could be heard along the avenue. On the desk lay several magazines provided by the hotel, offering information about the city and two guidebooks that I had brought from home. In their different ways, they conspired to suggest that an exciting and multifarious phenomenon called Madrid was waiting to be discovered outside, promising an embarrassment of monuments, churches, museums, fountains, plazas and shopping streets. And yet the prospect of those enticements, about which I had heard so much and which I knew I was privileged to be able to see, merely provoked in me a combination of listlessness and self-disgust at the contrast between my own indolence and what I imagined would have been the eagerness of more normal visitors.

How does a person come to be interested in the exact height at which he or she sees a fly? How does he or she begin to care about a piece of moss growing on a volcanic ridge ten inches wide? In Humboldt's case, such curiosity was far from spontaneous: his concern had a long history. The fly and the moss attracted his attention because they were related to prior, larger and—to the layman—more understandable questions. Curiosity might be pictured as being made up of chains of small questions extending outwards, sometimes over huge distances, from a central hub composed of a few blunt, large questions. In childhood we ask, ‘Why is there good and evil?' ‘How does nature work?' ‘Why am I me?' If circumstances and temperament allow, we then build on these questions during adulthood, our curiosity encompassing more and more of the world until at some point we may reach that elusive stage where we are bored by nothing. The blunt large questions become connected to smaller, apparently esoteric ones. We end up wondering about flies on the sides of mountains or about a particular fresco on the wall of a sixteenth-century palace. We start to care about the foreign policy of a long-dead Iberian monarch or about the role of peat in the Thirty Years' War.

A danger of travel is that we may see things at the wrong time, before we have had an opportunity to build up the necessary receptivity so that new information is as useless and fugitive as necklace beads without a connecting chain. The risk is compounded by geography in the way that cities contain buildings or monuments that may be only a few feet apart in space but are leagues apart in terms of what is required to appreciate them. Having made a journey to a place we may never revisit, we feel obliged to admire a sequence of things which have no connection to one another besides a geographic one and a proper understanding of which would require a range of qualities unlikely to be found in any one person. We are asked to be curious about Gothic architecture on one street and then promptly fascinated by Etruscan archaeology on the next.

The poet accused cities of fostering a family of life-destroying emotions: anxiety about our position in the social hierarchy, envy at the success of others, pride and a desire to shine in the eyes of strangers. City dwellers had no perspective, he alleged, they were in thrall to what was spoken of in the street or at the dinner table. However well provided for, they had a relentless desire for new things, which they did not genuinely lack and on which their happiness did not depend. And in this crowded, anxious sphere, it seemed harder than it did on an isolated homestead to begin sincere relationships with others. ‘One thought baffled my understanding,' wrote Wordsworth of his residence in London: ‘How men lived even next-door neighbours, as we say, yet still strangers, and knowing not each other's names.'

Since moving to France from his native Holland, he had felt it most particularly in relation to literature. He had read the works of Balzac, Flaubert, Zola and Maupassant and been grateful to those writers for opening his eyes to the dynamics of French society and psychology.

Van Gogh himself had feared he might encounter such accusations. To his sister, he wrote that many people already said of his work, ‘ “This really looks too strange,” not to mention those who think it a total abortion and utterly repulsive.' The reasons for such opinions were not hard to find: the walls of his houses were not always straight, the sun was not always yellow or the grass green, there was an exaggerated sense of movement in some of his trees. ‘I have played hell somewhat with the truthfulness of the colours,' he admitted, and he played similar hell with proportion, line, shadow and tone. Yet in playing hell, van Gogh was only making more explicit a process in which all artists are involved—namely, choosing which aspects of reality to include in a work and which to leave out. As Nietzsche knew, reality itself is infinite and can never be wholly represented in art. What made van Gogh unusual among Proverai artists was his choice of what he felt was important.

Ruskin's interest in beauty and in its possession led him to five central conclusions. First, beauty was the result of a number of complex factors that affected the mind both psychologically and visually. Second, humans had an innate tendency to respond to beauty and to desire to possess it. Third, there were many lower expressions of this desire for possession (including, as we have seen, buying souvenirs and carpets, carving one's name on a pillar and taking photographs). Fourth, there was only one way to possess beauty properly, and that was by understanding it, by making oneself conscious of the factors (psychological and visual) responsible for it. And last, the most effective means of pursuing this conscious understanding was by attempting to describe beautiful places through art, by writing about or drawing them, irrespective of whether one happened to have any talent for doing so.

Photography alone could not, and cannot, ensure such eating. True possession of a scene is a matter of making a conscious effort to notice elements and understand their construction. We can see beauty well enough just by opening our eyes, but how long this beauty will survive in memory depends on how intentionally we have apprehended it. The camera blurs the distinction between looking and noticing, between seeing and possessing; it may give us the option of true knowledge, but it may also unwittingly make the effort of acquiring that knowledge seem superfluous. It suggests that we have done all the work simply by taking a photograph, whereas proper eating of a place—a woodland, for example—requires that we pose ourselves a series of questions such as ‘How do the stems connect to the roots?' ‘Where is the mist coming from?' ‘Why does one tree seem darker than another?' These questions are implicitly asked and answered in the process of sketching.

It seemed an advantage to be travelling alone. Our responses to the world are crucially moulded by the company we keep, for we temper our curiosity to fit in with the expectations of others. They may have particular visions of who we are and hence may subtly prevent certain sides of us from emerging: ‘I hadn't thought of you as someone who was interested in flyovers,' they may intimidatingly suggest. Being closely observed by a companion can also inhibit our observation of others; then, too, we may become caught up in adjusting ourselves to the companion's questions and remarks, or feel the need to make ourselves seem more normal than is good for our curiosity. But alone in Hammersmith in the middle of a March afternoon, I had no such concerns. I had the freedom to act a little weirdly. I sketched the window of a hardware shop and word-painted the flyover.

Eight decades later, Nietzsche, who had read and admired de Maistre (and spent much time in his own room), picked up on the thought: When we observe how some people know how to manage their experiences—their insignificant, everyday experiences—so that they become an arable soil that bears fruit three times a year, while others—and how many there are!—are driven through surging waves of destiny, the most multifarious currents of the times and the nations, and yet always remain on top, bobbing like a cork, then we are in the end tempted to divide mankind into a minority (a minimality) of those who know how to make much of little, and a majority of those who know how to make little of much.

Dr. Paul MacLean, an evolutionary neuroanatomist and senior research scientist at the National Institute of Mental Health, has argued that the human brain is comprised of three distinct sub-brains, each the product of a separate age in evolutionary history. The trio intermingles and communicates, but some information is inevitably lost in translation because the subunits differ in their functions, properties, and even their chemistries. His neuroevolutionary finding of a three-in-one, or triune, brain can help explain how some of love’s anarchy arises from ancient history.

Often, as emotionality rises, so do sputtering, gesticulation, and mute frustration. Poetry, a bridge between the neocortical and limbic brains, is simultaneously improbable and powerful.

An evolutionary hierarchy of emotion stretches from the first reptilian precursor to our own richly nuanced apparatus. Fear is probably the limbic brain’s oldest emotion, an elaboration of the primordial reptilian startle. A touch of the heebie-jeebies helped early mammals safely navigate a world replete with dangers animate and inanimate—sharp teeth, dark caves, long claws, vertiginous heights. Disgust likewise serves to warn mammals of multifarious dangers—a tacit embodiment of Pasteur’s germ theory of disease, disgust affirms the invisible likelihood of contamination from rotting foods and gelatinous excretions. Such lifesaving nauseous revulsion is at least as ancient as the animal that takes most advantage of its existence: Mephitis mephitis, the striped skunk. The next emotions to sprout along the evolutionary tree assisted mammals in negotiating simple interactions. Anger readies a mammal for combat and warns others to expect a ferocious opponent. Jealousy alerts a mammal to the potential usurpation of reproductive chances. Later emotions inform social mammals with increasing precision about their status in a group—contempt, pride, guilt, shame, humiliation. The most recent emotions, and the ones least likely to be shared by other mammals, are those requiring a component of neocortical abstraction. Religious fervor is liable to be beyond the reach of nonhuman animals. So is the thrill that accompanies the realization of compact elegance in Pythagoras’ theorem or Newton’s gravitational law.

Rising activity in the emotion circuits produces not sound, but (among other things) a facial expression. When the neural excitation exceeds a shadowy threshold of awareness, what emerges is a feeling—the conscious experience of emotional activation. As neural activity diminishes, feeling intensity decreases, but some residual activity persists in those circuits after a feeling is no longer perceptible. Like the ghost of Hamlet’s father, an emotion appears suddenly in the drama of our lives to nudge the players in the proper direction, and then dissolves into nothingness, leaving behind a vague impression of its former presence.

Why should human contact—“gestures and gladness of countenance”—rank with food and water as a physiologic need? The British psychoanalyst John Bowlby picked up this trail in the 1950s. A natural renegade, Bowlby had barely completed his psychoanalytic training before he launched a revolution against the mother church. His creative blend of Freudian metapsychology and Lorenzian ethology produced attachment theory, a model that draws parallels between the bonding behavior of humans and animals. Bowlby theorized that human infants are born with a brain system that promotes safety by establishing an instinctive behavioral bond with their mothers. That bond produces distress when a mother is absent, as well as the drive for the two to seek each other out when the child is frightened or in pain. The same behavioral template is manifest in other young mammals, who also cry and cling and seek out their mothers when danger looms.

Human adults exhibit a protest response as much as any other mammal. Anyone who has been jilted in an infatuation (i.e., just about everybody) has experienced the protest phase firsthand—the inescapable inner restlessness, the powerful urge to contact the person (“just to talk”), mistaken glimpses of the lost figure everywhere (a seething combination of overly vigilant scanning and blind hope). All are part of protest. The drive to reestablish contact is sufficiently formidable that people often cannot resist it, even when they understand that the other person doesn’t want anything to do with them. Human beings manifest searching and calling in lengthy letters, frantic phone calls, repeated e-mails, and telephoning an answering machine just to hear another’s voice.

A lone puppy’s protest phase doesn’t last forever. Reunite the pup with his mother, and protest terminates. If the separation is prolonged, a mammal enters the second stage: despair. Like protest, despair is a coherent physiologic state—a set of behavioral inclinations and bodily reactions common to mammals. Despair begins with the collapse of fretfulness into lethargy: the animal stops his back-and-forthing, stops whimpering, and curls up in a despondent lump. He drinks little and may show no interest in food at all. If a peer or playmate is introduced into the pen, he may regard him with a bleary eye and turn away. He will have a slumped, dejected-looking posture and a sad facial expression. As the universality of emotional expressiveness lets us know, a mammal in despair looks miserable.

Anyone who has grieved a death has known despair from the inside: the leaden inertia of the body, the global indifference to everything but the loss, the aversion to food, the urge to closet oneself away, the inability to sleep, the relentless grayness of the world. Grief can give some insight into what it is like to have a major depression. Despair and depression are close cousins, enough so that despair in laboratory animals is often used as a model for human depressive illness. The disease state we call major depression in human beings may be a twisted variant of the despair reaction. But how and why the neural adaptations to loss can be unleashed inside the brain absent the usual trigger, death of a loved one, remains unknown.

Children aren’t the only ones whose bodies respond to the intricacies of loss: cardiovascular function, hormone levels, and immune processes are disturbed in adults subjected to prolonged separation. And so medical illness or death often follows the end of a marriage or the loss of a spouse. One study, for instance, found that social isolation tripled the death rate following a heart attack. Another found that going to group psychotherapy doubled the postsurgical lifespan of women with breast cancer. A third noted that leukemia patients with strong social supports had two-year survival rates more than twice that of those who lacked them.

Oxytocin levels surge in human mothers around birth—to stimulate labor and nursing, it was thought, but science sees those hormone levels in a new light. Experts have debated for decades about whether mothers and infants form a bond in the hours after parturition, and about the wisdom of separating the two at this time, as was the custom in Western in-hospital childbirth. High oxytocin levels around birth point to a crucial relationship event.

Who got drunk at your wedding? What color were your first lover’s eyes? Which actor starred opposite Myrna Loy in The Thin Man? If these questions generate answers, they do so only by the grace of the explicit memory system. Explicit memory, the more public of the brain’s twin storage machines, encodes event memories, including autobiographical recollections and discrete facts. When you need access to something you once knew or experienced, a moment’s mental sift presents a solution to consciousness. While explicit memory is swift and capacious, a fallacious sense of accuracy attends its frequently erroneous returns. New scanning technologies show that perception activates the same brain areas as imagination. Perhaps for this reason, the brain cannot reliably distinguish between recorded experience and internal fantasy. Oscar Wilde’s Miss Prism says in The Importance of Being Earnest, “Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.” Sharp Cecily replies, “Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and couldn’t possibly have happened.”

In the brain, a genetic blueprint directs the raising of rough neural scaffolds that serve as the cores of various subsystems. DNA thus reins in the riotous proliferation of designs that a hundred billion cells could freely generate.

Early experience trims a scaffold’s semiadjustable outline into a neural template: an assemblage of neurons and connections fine-tuned for function in a particular environment. Genetic information lays down the brain’s basic macro- and microanatomy; experience then narrows still-expansive possibilities into an outcome. Out of many, several; out of several, one.

After the template takes form, neural flexibility wanes, but often not to zero. And here the brain is like a sonnet that undergoes eternal editorial correction or a snowflake that follows a perpetual tumbling path, always adding crystals to hexagonal wings. Ongoing experience continues to mold neural connections, ensuring that one’s personality never rests.

Everything a person is and everything he knows resides in the tangled thicket of his intertwined neurons. These fateful, tiny bridges number in the quadrillions, but they spring from just two sources: DNA and daily life. The genetic code calls some synapses into being, while experience engenders and modifies others.

This developmental progression—general scaffold, vigorous neuronal thinning, specialized template, and evolving configuration—unfolds in most neural systems, including limbic ones. An infant’s emotional scaffold provides for temperament and for innate abilities like reading facial expressions. Limbic contact with his parents hones that pluripotential structure into the template of emotional life—the neural core of emotional identity. Once this quintessence is firm, we can say that a person exists, and we can know the individuated attributes of his emotional self. Ongoing experience gradually transforms his neural configuration, changing him from who he was into who he is, one synapse at a time. Emotional identity drifts over a lifetime—if fast and far enough, one may encounter a stranger’s heart where a friend’s or a lover’s once dwelt.

Genes can generate a limbic scaffold slanted toward shyness or a short temper as assuredly as they do long bones or a fair complexion. Dogs can be bred for their emotionality and usually are: breeders rely on the genetic transmission of temperament as they select for docility in the spaniel and ferocity in the pit bull. Certain strains of mice are thirty times more anxious than others; so are some human families. One brain’s blueprint may promote joy more readily than most; in another, pessimism reigns. Whether happiness infuses or eludes a person depends, in part, on the DNA he has chanced to receive.

Like most of their toys, children arrive with considerable assembly required. A child’s brain cannot develop normally without the coordinating influence that limbic communication furnishes. The coos and burbles that infants and parents exchange, the cuddling, rocking, and joyous peering into each other’s faces look innocuous if not inane; one would not suspect a life-shaping process in the offing. But from their first encounter, parents guide the neurodevelopment of the baby they engage with. In his primal years, they mold a child’s inherited emotional brain into the neural core of the self.

Before a child can say “bicycle” (much less ride one), he is modulating his emotions via an external source. A distraught baby reaches for his mother because an attuned parent can soothe him; he cannot soothe himself. As a consequence of thousands of these interactions, a child learns to self-quiet. His knowledge, like knowing how to keep a bike upright, is implicit—invisible, inarticulate, undeniable.

The child of emotionally balanced parents will be resilient to life’s minor shocks. Those who miss out on the practice find that in adulthood, their emotional footing pitches beneath them like the deck of a boat in rough waters. They are incomparably reactive to the loss of their anchoring attachments—without assistance, they are thrown back on threadbare resources. The end of a relationship is then not merely poignant but incapacitating.

Often no one is more surprised than the sufferer, who had no idea of his emotional frailty and the support networks of his native environs.

Initially, I felt an unsettling urgency for answers. But as I worked my way through college, majoring in philosophy and comparative religions, urgency gradually gave way to a growing, quiet joy in the study of life’s mysteries. By discarding the notion that I needed to be certain about what I believed, I decided that William James’s advice to “steer safely between the opposite dangers of believing too little or of believing too much” was the best and most difficult advice to follow. It wasn’t long before I realized that the meaning of life might well be found in the search for meaning itself.

Since this is a book about American moral and spiritual beliefs, it is, largely speaking, a book about American religion. Yet it does include a significant number of interviews with men and women who are decidedly nonreligious or even irreligious. I chose to include these not only because I know it is possible to live a meaningful life without a specific religious affiliation, but because I realize (as much, I’m afraid, from observing myself as others) that our professions of belief, however lofty, often exert little influence on our day-to-day lives.

Somewhere along the way it occurred to me that this book, dealing with religious and philosophical issues as it does, focuses directly on what may be the last taboo of American life. For what you will find discussed within these pages is seldom a topic of conversation at the typical American dinner party, or even in intimate talks among friends, where people focus more often upon work, family problems, and the political and economic issues of the day. Discussions about personal moral and spiritual beliefs are seldom encouraged. And if you bring them up, you run the risk of offending your hosts.

This American aversion to spiritual and existential matters can be traced, in part, to our nineteenth-century heritage of pragmatism. We are, after all, a practical people. We want answers, not problems. And I think we realize, if perhaps only subconsciously, that when dealing with moral and spiritual matters we do deal with mysteries—the insolubility of which we find deeply discomforting. Much of what we call American life is about this discomfort, and the manifold ways we seek to deny it or avoid it.

As Roger Walsh, a psychiatry professor I met in San Francisco, put it,  … you can see that basically our lives are, to a large extent, spent in avoiding a confrontation with ourselves. And then you can begin to make sense of the enormous amount of our culture’s daily activities, which attempt to distract us from ourselves, from deep reflection, from deep thinking, from existential confrontation. There’s a wonderful phrase by the philosopher Kierkegaard, “tranquilization by the trivial.” And I think American culture has mastered that better than any culture in history, simply because we have the wealth and means to do so.

As an oral historian, dealing with this last taboo of American life proved trying. In seeking out a significant diversity of Americans, from the exotic to the ordinary, it was often difficult to find people willing to talk openly about their beliefs. Others simply found it hard to express themselves on the subject. This was especially so among the middle- to upper-middle-class Americans I encountered, young and old alike. Unless they were ardent churchgoers, or had been forced to undergo a painful experience which caused them to reflect on their lives, most thought very little about moral or spiritual matters. When religion did come up, more often than not it was a subject for jokes, not serious consideration. Religion was about Jimmy Swaggart, Jim and Tammy Bakker, or the hokum of faith-healing hucksters.

My experiences at the New York Stock Exchange were equally comedic, although tainted, too, by a sense of failure and disappointment. Time and again I convinced Italian-suited Wall Street stock traders to sit down and talk with me, and time and again they told me they cared about the agonies of the downtrodden and would turn their efforts to a social service profession just as soon as they made enough money. “How much is enough?” I’d ask. Alexander Curry responded much as they all did: “I’d say that for an individual to live a fair, comfortable life-style you need $100,000 in interest income a year. But I don’t think that would be enough for me probably.” For many of them, it seemed, theirs was really the philosophy of get yours, get it now, get it quick. They just couldn’t ’fess up to it.

Others here would have their beliefs transformed by painful and inescapable experiences; experiences which forced them to contend with the problem of evil, first formulated in the West by the Roman philosopher Anicus Boethius around 500 B.C.E.: “If there is a God, whence proceed so many evils? If there is no God, whence cometh any good?” I think now, for example, of Elizabeth Jaranyi, a Hungarian-born Jew who spent time in the Auschwitz Concentration Camp during World War II: “In Auschwitz, everybody pray, everybody pray and pray and pray. I lost my husband. I lost my child. I saw my sister shot to death before my eyes. I was beaten. And when I saw the crematorium, I didn’t pray anymore. I was so angry! And when I came home, I’m absolutely not a God-believer again.”

You know of the disease in Central Africa called sleeping sickness.… There also exists a sleeping sickness of the soul. Its most dangerous aspect is that one is unaware of its coming. That is why you have to be careful. As soon as you notice the slightest sign of indifference, the moment you become aware of the loss of a certain seriousness, of longing, of enthusiasm and zest, take it as a warning. You should realize that your soul suffers if you live superficially. People need times in which to concentrate, when they can search their inmost selves. It is tragic that most men have not achieved this feeling of self-awareness. And finally, when they hear the inner voice they do not want to listen anymore. They carry on as before so as not to be constantly reminded of what they have lost. But as for you, resolve to keep a quiet time both in your homes and here within these peaceful walls when the bells ring on Sundays. Then your souls can speak to you without being drowned out by the hustle and bustle of everyday life. —Albert Schweitzer

Focusing on this dark side of belief, many have argued that the most effective way to promote peace is to encourage wide-scale doubt and disbelief, operating under the assumption, as Peter Ustinov once put it, that “we are united by our doubts and divided by our convictions.” True enough. Yet it is clear to me from my studies and travels that the human need to believe is far too strong to abolish. The resurgence of religion in the Soviet Union confirms this. What may be needed more than doubt or a healthy skepticism is the capacity to temper our convictions (and the pride they promote) with the recognition that our beliefs will be rejected by others. Meaningful living in the modern world therefore requires, more than ever before, the ability to lead a dual life. In our private lives we must live and act as though our beliefs and values are the most important thing in the world. In our public lives we must respect the right of others to believe as they choose and carry our commitment to tolerance as far as possible before we attempt to limit or halt the activities of those who, by acting on their own deep convictions, bring hardship or harm to others. A commitment to tolerance requires only that we be “intolerant of intolerance.” To outspokenly condemn the views of Jews, neo-Nazis, pro-choice advocates or Christian fundamentalists is one thing; to bring harm to them or even kill them for their views is a far different thing. A belief in tolerance therefore requires the courage to defend the rights of the weak against the bigotries of the strong.

I’ve come more and more, and very reluctantly, and I’ve fought it every inch of the way, to a worldview which is more and more similar to the kind of perennial philosophy of the mystics. I find myself agreeing that things are not as they seem, that we’re not as we seem, and that what we take to be normality is a form of arrested development, a truncation of human possibility. What we take to be normality is actually a form of consensus trance, or hypnosis, or dream, or collective sleep. We live in the biggest cult of all: culture.

Our culture has hypnotized us from birth, because there seem to be realms and possibilities for human development far, far, far beyond what we’ve accessed. And those realms have been pointed to by the great sages of human history, who have awoken from the collective trance, who have dehypnotized and detribalized, who have experienced enlightenment, liberation, salvation, whatever you want to call it. They are the ones who have been able to step outside the limiting and distorting cultural beliefs within which all of the rest of us remain enmeshed.

I now believe that the fundamental nature of reality is consciousness, that all that we see is a creation of Mind. Zen calls it the “One Mind,” others call it God or Allah … whatever. But in the depths of ourselves, our mind, our psyche, our soul, and in the deepest realizations and awakenings, we recognize that we are an aspect of that. One comes to recognize the truth of the sayings that have been echoed throughout history: “the Kingdom of heaven is within you” (Christianity); “Look within, thou art the Buddha” (Buddhism); “He who knows himself knows the Lord” (Muhammad); and “Atman (individual consciousness) and Brahman (God) are One” (Hinduism). I think the idea I’m expressing is not that man is God, by any means, but that there is at-one-ment “with” God, and that what we awaken to is the recognition that the sense of separation is an illusion. So that’s very different than saying man is God, and that’s a big, big difference.

Looking out at the world and seeing the fact that, you know, in this hour and a half of interview, three thousand people are gonna die of starvation and we’re gonna spend a fifth of a billion dollars on arms, it seems imperative to me that we wake up from this dangerous collective sleep. I look at the state of the world and I see an inconceivable amount of untold suffering, and I feel compelled to do something. I’ve been pulled by my philosophy toward a recognition that the deeper we go into ourselves, the more we recognize our common humanity, our unity, our oneness, etcetera. And it feels like not to do something would be almost inconceivable, so a lot of my work is concerned with global issues.

Although the outcomes element of the Trinity is mandatory, the experience element is perhaps the most critical. For any organization that is stuck in a rut and unable to find any real actionable insights from behavior and outcomes—no matter how hard they try—the recommendation is to invest in experience analysis. This is the why. This is the warm hug when you are stymied and tortured by your clickstream data and you want to tear your hair out.

It is hard to choose a favorite among your children, but for me experience is without question the favorite. The reason is quite simple: experience analysis allows us to get into the heads of our customers and gain insight or an a-ha about why they do the things they do.

There are many ways to understand the experience of customers on your website. You can leverage surveys and simply ask them, or there are very complex statistical quantitative and qualitative methodologies you can bring to bear. Surveys will allow you to measure customer satisfaction and even predict future behavior (likelihood to buy or to recommend your products or services). As will be clear throughout this book, I am a huge believer of experimentation and testing (let’s have the customers tell us what they prefer) by using either the A/B testing methodology or multivariate testing. We also have the traditional user-centric design techniques at our disposal, such as heuristic evaluations. We can also leverage lab usability testing as another great option or do follow-me-homes (site visits), a concept advocated by Scott Cook, the founder of Intuit as the essence of the Customer Driven Innovation (CDI) mindset.

If the right version of the product for a particular website customer is Basic and not the Professional edition, our job as site owners is for us to help customers figure that out and buy Basic. Yes, we can make more money in the short term if the customer buys Professional today. But it is quite likely that the customer will buy Professional, use it, get frustrated because it is too advanced for them, and we’ll never see them again (and they will share their suboptimal experience with others). But if we help them buy the right version, Basic, then next year they’ll be back for Professional. Trinity aims to solve for the long term.

Another example is passing the (again anonymous) session_ids to your survey tool so that you can segment the most unhappy customers based on survey results. You can then use your web analytics tool to analyze the clickstream data and see what pages happy customers saw as compared to unhappy customers. Or you could see what website experience drives better customer satisfaction, and so forth.

The core goal of measuring the why, or qualitative analysis, is to understand the rationale behind the metrics and trends that we see and to actively incorporate the voice of the customer (VOC) into our decision making. The following user-centric design (UCD) and human-computer interaction (HCI) methodologies are commonly used to understand the customer perspective: • Surveys • Heuristic evaluations • Usability testing (lab and remote) • Site visits (or follow-me-homes)

There is a huge mindset challenge to convince all the “quant jocks” (up and down the management chain) to see the value of qualitative data, and perhaps most important, to start to think differently because analysis of research data poses completely different opportunities and challenges.

I recommend that you have at least one continuous listening program in place. Usually the most effective mechanism for continuous listening, benchmarking, and trending is surveying. It is extremely cost-effective to use one of the many industry providers (such as ForeSee Results or iPerceptions) to implement surveying that is geared toward teasing out critical facts—such as why people come to your website, what their task completion rate is, whether they are satisfied, whether they are more or less likely to buy as a result of their website visit, what they would like fixed, and more.

Or if your revenue has increased 30 percent from last month, is that success? In each of these scenarios, the answer could be a whopping yes. But it is missing the critical ecosystem context: what is happening in the landscape that could have caused these outcomes vs. what you are causing? It could be that visitors on the Web went up 70 percent in your category. Or perhaps your ROI increased because your competitor stopped their campaigns. Or your competitor’s revenue increased 80 percent because of all those new visitors, but you could manage only 30 percent.

True delight comes from knowing how you are doing vis-a-vis your competitors or the industry as a whole. This competitive intelligence is key to helping you understand your performance in the context of the greater web ecosystem and allows you to better understand whether a certain result is caused by eco-system trends or your actions (or lack thereof). Having a focused competitive intelligence program (which can be all of half a person in reality) can help you exploit market trends, build off the success of your competitors, or help optimize your search engine marketing program—because you know exactly what your competitor is doing.

Benefits of Using Hitwise (ISP-Based Measurement) • The sample size is much bigger; this is a huge benefit. • The basic data capture mechanism means they have a much more diverse pool of people providing data. Participants don’t have to agree to have their anonymous data analyzed, and there is higher likelihood that the ISP-based measurement system covers a significantly more diverse set of surfing habits and a more diverse population. • ISP-based methodologies such as those used by Hitwise also have much deeper and richer search engine traffic data. • The psychographic (demographic, lifestyle) data Hitwise provides via the Prizm database is significantly better than self-reporting of such data. • Hitwise has a lot more on-demand reporting available through their web access interface, which is very much amenable to self-service.

Sometimes we do this in a lab environment (complete with one-way mirrors and cameras pointed at the participants), other times we do this in people’s native environments (offices, homes, and so forth), and still other times we use surveys to monitor key metrics such as customer satisfaction and task completion rates. The greatest benefit of user research is that it allows all of us to get really close to our customers and get a real-world feel for their needs, wants, and perceptions of interactions with our websites.

Lab usability tests measure a user’s ability to complete tasks. Usability tests are best for optimizing User Interface (UI) designs and work flows, understanding the customer’s voice, and understanding what customers really do. In a typical usability test, a user attempts to complete a task or set of tasks by using a website (or software or a product). Each of these tasks has a specified goal with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction identified in a specified usage context.

Preparing the Test The main steps in the preparation phase are as follows: 1. Identify the critical tasks that you are testing for. (For example, for Amazon.com: How easy it is for our customers to return a product or request a replacement?) 2. For each task, create scenarios for the test participant. (For example: You ordered a Sony digital camera from us. When you got the box, it was missing a lens cap. You would like to contact Amazon for help. What do you do next?) 3. For each scenario, identify what success looks like. (For example: The user found the correct page, abc.html, on the support site, followed the link to the Contact Amazon web page, filled out a request, and clicked the Submit button.) 4. Identify who your test participants should be (new users, existing users, people who shop at competitors’ sites, and so forth). 5. Identify a compensation structure for the participants. 6. Contact a recruiter, in your company or outside, to recruit the right people for you. 7. Do dry runs of the test with someone internal to the company just to make sure your scripts and other elements work fine. You’ll find issues in these pilots that you can clean up before you do the real thing.

Conducting the Test The rubber hits the road—you get to see real people! The main steps in this phase are as follows: 1. Welcome your participants and orient them to the environment. (“You are here at our company, and there is a mirror, and people are watching you, and we are recording this, and you can do no wrong, so don’t worry.”) 2. Starting with a “think aloud” exercise is a good idea. You want to “hear” what the participants are thinking, and this exercise will train them to “talk their thoughts.” The main goal is to really understand and uncover the problems they will surely have. 3. Have the participants read the tasks aloud to ensure that they read the whole thing and understand the task or scenario. 4. Watch what the participants are doing and carefully observe their verbal and nonverbal clues so you can see where the participants fail in their tasks or if they misunderstand what your web pages say or if they go down the wrong path. 5. The moderator can ask the participants follow-up questions to get more clarity (but be careful not to give out answers and absolutely watch your own verbal and nonverbal clues so as to be as calm and reassuring as you can to the participant). 6. Thank the participants in the end and make sure to pay them right away.

Analyzing the Data The main steps in this phase are as follows: 1. As soon as possible, hold a debriefing session with all the observers so that everyone can share their thoughts and observations. 2. Take time to note trends and patterns. 3. Do a deep dive analysis with a goal of identifying the root causes of failures based on actual observations. (For example: The FAQ answers on the website were too long. The Contact Us link was not apparent and hidden “below the fold.” It was not clear that they could not contact us via phone. Or almost everyone complained that their expectations were not set about when to expect a reply.) The moderator is responsible for tallying successes and failures by each participant for each task. 4. Make recommendations to fix the problems identified. Usually you create a PowerPoint deck that collects all the scores. Then for each critical task identify the points of failure, make concrete recommendations that will improve the customer experience, and categorize the recommendations into Urgent, Important, and Nice to Have (to help business decision makers prioritize).

Unlike a full usability test, a heuristic evaluation can provide valuable feedback at low cost and in a short amount of time (as little as hours) and can identify obvious usability problems. Heuristic evaluations are best for optimizing work flows, improving user interface design, and understanding the overall level of usability of the website. However, like all rules of thumb, heuristic evaluations are not guaranteed to lead to correct answers, especially to subtle problems. Researchers leading the tests and the designers and other experts participating in the evaluation are still very close to the website. They are attempting to use best practices and their own wisdom, but they are not the customers. Hence heuristic evaluations are best at identifying the most obvious problems. They can provide critical input into narrowing the field from fifteen solutions to the five that can then undergo full usability or online experimentation and testing.

Now that you are hopefully all excited about leveraging heuristic evaluations for your website, here are the six steps to conducting a successful evaluation process: 1. Use primary research (surveys) or partner with the website owner to understand the core tasks that the customers are expected to complete on the website. Here are some examples of scenarios: • Find information about the top-selling product on the website. • Locate a store closest to where the customer lives. • Place an order on the website by using PayPal. (If the website doesn’t accept PayPal, how easily and quickly can a customer find that out?) • Check the delivery status of an order placed on the website. • Successfully contact tech support via email. • Pick the right product for customer profile x (where x can be a small business owner or a family of four or someone who is allergic to peanuts). • Sign up for a company newsletter. 2. Next, establish success benchmarks for each task (for example: success rate for finding information about top selling product = 95 percent, locating a store = 80 percent, and so forth). 3. Walk through each task as a customer would and make note of the key findings in the experience—everything from how long it takes to complete the tasks, to how many steps it takes, to hurdles in accomplishing the tasks. 4. Make note of the specific rule violations against the best-practices checklist. 5. Create a report of your findings. The most common format used is PowerPoint with a screen shot of the web page and clear call-outs for issues found. 6. Categorize the recommendations into Urgent, Important, and Nice to Have, to help business decision makers prioritize. Recommendations should be made regardless of technical feasibility (don’t worry about what can be implemented—you are representing the customer, and the IT team can figure out how to implement).

General 1. Do not obstruct or compete with users’ critical tasks. 2. Present elements related to specific tasks based on frequency, importance, or sequence. 3. Use buttons and links consistently. Always use the same label for the same function. 4. Pages should push no unexpected animation or sound at users. 5. Allow users to purchase without registering. Page Layout 6. Lay out objects hierarchically to match the user’s expected task flow: left to right or top to bottom. Most users start by scanning the content area. 7. Ensure manageable page lengths. Don’t use scrolling on home pages and make sure interior pages are fewer than 2.5 screens. 8. Ensure that pages can be easily printed and that printing does not cut off critical information. If this is not practical, provide a printable version. Visual Design 9. Avoid using color as the only source of important data. 10. Don’t design critical information so it looks like advertising. Navigation 11. Use persistent navigation to support frequent movement between tasks. 12. Don’t force users to hover over something to see options. 13. Link names should communicate the content of the page they link to. Avoid generic links such as Click Here and More. 14. Underline all links. Do not underline any other words. Everything clickable should have a roll-over effect. 15. Links should change color to indicate which links the user has visited. Content 16. Use your users’ vocabulary. 17. Write content that is bloat-free (short and simple), correct (spelling, grammar), in the active voice, and interesting. 18. Show price, or lack thereof. 19. Allow users to compare products side by side. Comparison tables should facilitate product differentiation. Readability 20. Use 10-point font or larger for all text. 21. Maintain high contrast between background and text colors. 22. Use bulleted lists, introductory summaries, clear titles, and stand-alone chunks to facilitate scanning. 23. Use relative rather than fixed fonts. Search 24. Display a Search box in the upper-right corner of every page. 25. Chunk search results into categories (for example, product information, support, press releases). Sources: Nielsen/Norman, Human Factors International

Benefits of Heuristic Evaluations • Heuristic evaluations are extremely fast to perform, with a very quick time to insights. • They can leverage your existing resources in the company. • They can identify the most egregious customer issues on your website (often all the low- and medium-hanging fruit). • They can be used very effectively early in the website development process to find potential hurdles. • They can reduce the cost of full usability tests by helping fix the obvious problems. Usability tests can then be focused on hidden or tougher challenges. Things to Watch For • Usually experts in the company (or from outside) lead heuristic evaluations and they use best practices and their own experience, but they are not our customers. • When there is disagreement in recommendations from the heuristic evaluations, that can be great input for live web testing or usability tests. • Heuristic evaluations are best for optimizing work flows, website design, and overall usability of the website.

Conducting the Site Visit The exciting part—you get to see people! Here are the main steps: 1. Remember that 80 percent of your time should be spent observing during the site visit. Practice patience. 2. Ask your customers to show you what they do when you are not there. Watch your customers, listen to them, and look for verbal and nonverbal clues. Let them teach you—let them show you how they are solving their problems. 3. Think of your intents behind how you would solve the customers’ problems and think of better ways of helping them as you see in the real world how they experience your website. 4. Don’t teach or help the customers or provide them with tips and tricks. 5. The moderator can ask a few clarifying questions, but remember the 80-20 rule (80 percent observation). 6. During the visit, look for small details and be prepared to be surprised. Surprises are a good thing in this case because from them will emerge solutions that will make your company unique in how it solves customer challenges. 7. Thank the customers in the end and make sure to pay them right away.

Surveys (Questionnaires) Surveys are both the most used of the UCD methods and perhaps the least appreciated in terms of their value. They are the optimal method for collecting feedback from a very large number of customers (participants) relatively inexpensively and quickly. The law of large numbers means that conclusions based on survey data, if done right, will be more accurate and reliable and provide insights and conclusions that help us better understand customer perspectives.

There is no beating around the bush on this one. For most website or post-visit surveys, the best practice is not to provide incentives. Customers want to share their experiences on your website and let you know how you can improve it for them. Incentives usually skew the data because the incentive becomes the motivation, and this usually reduces the quality of the data. It is also harder to detect the pollution in the data. If you don’t have enough respondents, try to optimize the questions, structure, and triggers. Consider incentives only as a last resort.

Perhaps the single biggest reason that senior decision makers don’t take action on survey recommendations is that they don’t have context. We run our survey, we measure questions on a scale of 10 or 100, and we provide a rating. Question: Do you like our website? Answer: 7 out of 10. Now is that great? Is that bad? External benchmarks are great because they give context, and they shame us (when we are below the benchmark) or give us joy and pride (when we beat the benchmark). But most of all they drive action. The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) is one such benchmark. The index measures half of the US economy, and its various indices form an awesome global benchmark (available for free at www.theacsi.org).

Another company that is developing its own methodology and benchmarks by industry is iPerceptions. They have developed benchmarks for hospitality, auto, media, financial services, retail, and business to business (B2B) industries. iPerceptions also has a great built-in slice-and-dice framework to “play” with data to find insights.

You also don’t have to spam everyone with a survey. Usually 1,100 to 1,400 survey responses are statistically significant (even if you slice and dice it into small pieces). So for most high-traffic websites, if the survey is shown to about 3 to 5 percent of visitors who meet our criteria and if we get a 5 percent response rate, that would easily meet the number we need.The great thing about this is that you will only “bother” a very small percent of your site visitors.

Integrate with Clickstream Data You can turbocharge your survey analysis if you can figure out how to tie your survey responses to your clickstream data. If your survey technology vendor is a good one, they will accept external variables that you can pass into the survey. Simply pass the 100 percent anonymous unique_ cookie_id and a session_id (or equivalent values from your website platform).These two values are also being captured in your clickstream data. When you do find interesting groups of responses (customer segments) in your survey response, you can go back and put those anonymous unique_cookie_ids and session_ids into your clickstream tool and see the referring URLs of these unhappy people, where they clicked, what pages they saw, where they exited, and so forth.

Advanced surveying technologies are now quite affordable, especially after you consider how much revenue your website is making or how many customers are being upset by a suboptimal support experience and picking up the phone to call you. Other than clickstream data, surveying is perhaps the cheapest continual method. None of the other usability methodologies can even come close (either in their cost or in the number of customers you can hear from).

Take your own e-commerce website as an example. Measuring its primary purpose (by asking customers, “Why are you here today?”) will illustrate that a minority of the website traffic comes to purchase—usually about 15-25 percent of the traffic at best. The rest of the traffic comes to research, look for jobs, check on their order status, email complaints, check prices, learn more about the company, download images or other data, and on and on. The majority does not come to buy.

It is important not to underestimate the challenge of moving from a company (short-term) focus to a customer (long-term) focus. It is extremely hard for most company employees to pull off (the mindsets are more entrenched the higher up you go in an organization). Most compensation models and reward systems are geared toward rewarding short-term success and getting one more website visitor converted. You will have to work hard to prove the corny, but utterly true, notion that if you solve for your customers, you will solve for your company as well.

These are all requests for reports; they are not business questions. What we want to do is refocus the discussion and increase the likelihood that you can be something more than a report writer. I recommend that you go back to your key stakeholders (the higher up in the organization, the better) and ask them politely what real business questions they are grappling with that you can help answer. Business questions have these three characteristics: • They are usually open-ended and at a much higher level, leaving you room to think and add value. • They likely require you to go outside your current systems and sources to look for data and guidance in order to measure success. • They rarely include columns and rows into which you can plunk data you already have.

Are you treating your top 10 entry pages as just as important as your home page? Do this promptly because they are setting your website’s first impression. Because your home page is no longer the “home page,” the top entry pages should be leveraged to run your most prominent promotions (merchandising or otherwise). It is quite common that the big “news” of the website is on the home page, but 70 percent of visitors don’t even see the home page.

You have so little actionable insight because clickstream data is great at the what, but not at the why. That is one of the limits of clickstream data. We know every click that everyone ever makes and more. We have the what: What pages did people view on our website? What products did people purchase? What was the average time spent? What sources did they come from? What keywords or campaigns produced clicks? What this, and what that, and what not?

In the traditional business intelligence world, we were taught to seek the “single source of the truth.” Bring all data into one place; build massive systems, usually over multiple years; and celebrate. Sadly, this strategy is toxic on the Web. At the eMetrics summit in 2003, Guy Creese presented the concept of Multiplicity. The concept was brutal in its simplicity: multiple constituencies, tools, and types of data sources make it much harder to do effective analytics.

Certain bodily rhythms fall into synchrony with the ebb and flow of day and night. These rhythms are termed circadian, from the Latin for “about a day.” A more fitting appellation is circumlucent, because they revolve around light as surely as Earth. Human physiology finds a hub not only in light, but also in the harmonizing activity of nearby limbic brains. Our neural architecture places relationships at the crux of our lives, where, blazing and warm, they have the power to stabilize. When people are hurting and out of balance, they turn to regulating affiliations: groups, clubs, pets, marriages, friendships, masseuses, chiropractors, the Internet. All carry at least the potential for emotional connection. Together, those bonds do more good than all the psychotherapists on the planet.

Given the dual agents in his armamentarium—one of them human, one chemical, both limbically formidable—a psychiatrist must decide when to use each. The first issue is easy: the best of biologically minded healers always wield the limbic component, since it is inherent, effective, and side-effect free. But when to prescribe an agent other than the doctor himself? In some cases, medications are literally lifesaving: major depression and bipolar disorder still claim thousands each year. Easing frank suffering and curbing emotional morbidity are goals that, in these pharmacologically sophisticated times, most people accept without question. Still, many clinical encounters do not contain the defining element of such urgency. Often, patients contemplate taking medication not to stave off death or a recognized illness, but simply to help them reach a happier state. To some people, a pharmacological route smacks of an immoral shortcut, as though they are snatching a boon without enduring arduous qualifying trials that a stern universe surely demands. If a person enters psychotherapy and emerges, years later, with his moodiness banished or anxiety erased, nobody thinks he has cheated destiny or disapproving gods. If he takes a pill, and reaches the same goal in a few days or weeks, many will wonder—is that permissible, legitimate, fair? “People must work to better themselves” is an intuitive (and often correct) philosophy, one that in this instance finds a voice in the therapists, still numerous, who tell patients that medication and psychotherapy’s edifying labor don’t mix.

Psychotherapy is as specific as any attachment. When Lorenz imprinted goslings, they followed him but not other Austrian ethologists. A golden retriever outside a grocery store has only his owner in mind. And a patient attaches to the therapist he has. The unsettling corollary: a therapy’s results are particular to that relationship. A patient doesn’t become generically healthier; he becomes more like the therapist. New-sprung styles of relatedness, burgeoning knowledge of relationships and how to conduct them, unthinking moves in the ballet of loving—all shift closer to those in the mind of the healer a patient has chosen.

But if therapy works, it transforms a patient’s limbic brain and his emotional landscape forever. The person of the therapist will determine the shape of the new world a patient is bound for; the configuration of his limbic Attractors fixes those of the other.

The evolution of the limbic brain a hundred million years ago created animals with luminescent powers of emotionality and relatedness, their nervous systems designed to intertwine and support each other like supple strands of a vine. But in life, as on the Greek stage, every attribute confers a matching vulnerability; each heroic strength finds its mirror image in a tragic flaw. So it is with the neural skills that constitute emotional life. The limbic brain bestows experiential riches denied simpler creatures, but it also opens mammals up to torment and destruction. An alligator never feels the pain of loss, and a rattlesnake never suffers illness or death upon separation from its parents or progeny. Mammals can and do. The neural structures responsible for emotional lives are not infinitely adaptable. Just as the dinosaur body was built to live within a range of temperature, so the limbic brain chains mammals to a certain emotional climate. The giant reptiles vanished when the skies darkened and temperatures fell. Our downfall is equally assured if we push our living conditions beyond the limits our emotional heritage decrees.

Loving is limbically distinct from in love. Loving is mutuality; loving is synchronous attunement and modulation. As such, adult love depends critically upon knowing the other. In love demands only the brief acquaintance necessary to establish an emotional genre but does not demand that the book of the beloved’s soul be perused from preface to epilogue. Loving derives from intimacy, the prolonged and detailed surveillance of a foreign soul.

The contrast between that culture and our own could not be more evident. Limbic pursuits sink slowly and steadily lower on America’s list of collective priorities. Top-ranking items remain the pursuit of wealth, physical beauty, youthful appearance, and the shifting, elusive markers of status. There are brief spasms of pleasure to be had at the end of those pursuits—the razor-thin delight of the latest purchase, the momentary glee of flaunting this promotion or that unnecessary trinket—pleasure here, but no contentment. Happiness is within range only for adroit people who give the slip to America’s values. These rebels will necessarily forgo exalted titles, glamorous friends, exotic vacations, washboard abs, designer everything—all the proud indicators of upward mobility—and in exchange, they may just get a chance at a decent life.

Cultural awareness of limbic principles informs the kind of measures we expect to prevail in the war on drugs. Will lectures on the evils of chemical dependency deter teenagers from a life of substance dependence? Don’t believe it. While their end is worthy, such talk targets the neocortical brain, not the limbic one. Pain is too potent a motivator for facts to undo. Pretending otherwise is a threadbare illusion convincing only to those who already feel basically well. The insouciance of Just Say No assumes that the human brain and will are separable. They are not. Limbic instability undermines the neural capacity for resolve that jaunty slogans call upon.

Steeped as they are in limbic physiology, healthy people have trouble forcing their minds into the unfamiliar outline of this reptilian truth: no intrinsic restraint on harming people exists outside the limbic domain. Preparing soldiers for combat involves not only teaching them physical skills necessary to vanquish opponents but also indoctrinating the emotional outlook that creates an Enemy. That psychological goal is achieved by severing mental bonds between Us and Them while simultaneously strengthening intragroup ties. The Enemy is not like us, both sides tell prospective combatants, they are subnormal, inhuman, less than animals. The average infantryman fights not for lofty political ideals, but because homicidal fiends threaten him and the family of buddies with whom he has labored, suffered, and loved. History brims with the brutality that flows between groups when no limbic tie unites them.

The urge to embed oneself in a family—to hold an endeavor in common with others, to be part of a team, a band, a group that struggles together toward a common victory—is an indomitable aspect of the human mind and brain. In a culture whose members are ravenous for love and ignorant of its workings, too many will invest their love in a barren corporate lot, and will reap a harvest of dust.

Anyway one day I was with this guy, Juan, a friend of mine, and this other girl, a waitress, and her friend the waitress. I dropped a bit of acid Juan gave me and was just hanging out being a street person, playing chess, watching life, and then they all just got up to go off and have dinner somewhere. And I just suddenly thought, Geez, I want to go have dinner with them. Why can’t I go with them and have dinner? What a pleasant bunch of people to be with. So I asked them, “Can I come along?” And for some reason it didn’t seem like they wanted me. By this time the acid was really coming on. The end of it is that I lost control. It was the first time in my life that I ever lost control of my emotions. And what hit me at this time was that these people who were leaving me were friends, but not deep friends like the kids I grew up with in New York. ‘All of a sudden I remembered these kids. I’m never going to see them again. I’m never going to see that girl I loved; they’re scattered to the four winds. And it just hit me. My God, what kind of relationships with other people do I have!

Your network is hugely important to your career, so you don’t want to lose track of anyone you meet. Take your pick from a computer contact system (such as Microsoft Outlook, Palm, or others), a Rolodex, a business card organizer, or an old-fashioned address book (with information written in pencil since contact data changes so often). It doesn’t matter what you use as long as you have a system that works for you. If you choose computer software, be sure to print out your contact list occasionally and have a backup method, in case your computer crashes or you lose your laptop. On that note, I also would advise against keeping contact information only in your cell phone or handheld, just in case the device breaks or gets misplaced.

As a high school student attending Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, Drayton established the Asia Society and turned it into the school’s most popular student organization. He took over the school’s literary magazine, The Mirror, and reinvigorated it. He joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and in 1957, at the age of fourteen, organized a boycott of the local Woolworth store to protest its discriminatory practices. When school administrators threatened him with disciplinary action, Drayton went around stapling signs to trees denouncing segregation, then dispatched letters to elected officials. In response to one of his letters, the headmaster of Phillips Academy received a telephone call from Hubert Humphrey, then a U.S. Senator from Minnesota, who had called to defend the boy’s right to demonstrate. Humphrey won a fan for life, and Drayton learned that it pays to write letters.

He’s trained to qualify, control, and close most of the people who walk in, prospects who just don’t know much.

GEOGRAPHY 101 If your first inclination would be to buy your new car from the nearest dealer, put that idea on hold for awhile. The reason: Often the best deal will come from dealers who are further away—maybe much further away. They’ll look at you as “found business,” a prospect who would never walk in their door. They might give you a deal they’d never give to someone in their town. (Since you don’t live there, you won’t be telling everyone that they’re almost giving cars away.) Contact your local dealer only after canvassing the others. If they can meet your best out-of-town offer or come reasonably close, why not buy from them? If they can’t, why not take the better offer?

PSYCHOLOGY 101 Of course, you have to visit car stores to test drive the vehicles you’re considering and finalize your choice. As we recommend in chapter 13, you will announce up front that you’re there only to test drive, not to buy—that you’ve got an appointment to test another car in 90 minutes and that you’re going to keep the appointment. On those visits, avoid showing even the smallest display of enthusiasm for any vehicle. Car salesmen are trained to make the purchase process as emotional as possible. They believe that if they can get you excited about that car, they can sell it to you before you leave for that next appointment. How do you avoid giving salespeople that signal?

When you’re buying a new car, the salesman has three balls in the air, three important areas of opportunity where he can make money on the transaction. 1. He can make money on the front end, on the difference between your purchase price and the dealer’s cost on that new vehicle. 2. He can make money on the back end, selling you things like financing (with related life and disability insurance), extended warranty coverage, and dealer add-on options like rustproofing and fabric protection. 3. If the deal includes your trade-in vehicle, he can make money on the difference between what the car store really pays for your car and what they get for it, either by retailing it through their own used-car department or by wholesaling it to a used-car dealer. If it surprises you to learn that there can be more profit potential in the second and third areas than in the first, you are in the group that needs this book the most.

Here’s the way most people approach the purchase process: • They start by visiting car stores and getting excited about specific cars in the presence of car salesmen. (That’s a really bad idea.) • Then, still in “new-car heat,” they wonder out loud how they’ll pay for that pretty thing, and (you guessed it) the salesman tells them how easy it’ll be. (Another bad idea.) • Finally, too confused to turn suddenly rational, they wonder out loud what their current car is worth in trade, and they accept the number the salesman gives them without checking it out themselves.

Smart buyers don’t rely on car salesmen for any important information. They don’t give them any either. Smart buyers have a shopping plan that reverses the sequence that most people follow: • They start by focusing on the car they’ve got. They know that they’re either going to sell it themselves or trade it in, and that the proceeds represent an important part of the new car’s down payment. So they begin by finding out how much their vehicle is really worth in their market today, both at retail and at wholesale. • Then they decide whether they’ll sell it themselves at retail or trade it in at wholesale. (They know the difference affects the money available for their down payment.) • Then they turn to the essential financial questions. They decide on the monthly payment they can handle comfortably, including auto insurance, which costs a lot more for new cars than for old ones. They also determine the down payment they can afford. They know that bigger is better, so they find some loose cash to add to what they’ll get for their current car. • They take all this information and shop for money before they shop seriously for a car or truck. This gives them a good fix on the maximum amount they can pay for a new vehicle, including all the miscellaneous sales taxes and license fees that many salesmen don’t mention until you’re committed to a price for the car. It also provides a basis for measuring the attractiveness of the financing offered by the dealer or manufacturer. • They study the advantages and disadvantages of leasing versus buying and decide whether they are candidates to lease. If they are, they do additional homework to understand the key elements of leasing, including exactly how to do the arithmetic to determine the monthly payment. • Concurrently, they’re reading articles on the vehicles they’re interested in for information to help narrow their choices, and they’re visiting car stores to obtain brochures and take test drives. But they make it clear from the start that they are not going to buy on those visits, and they avoid getting into any salesman’s “closing room” because they know they’re not ready. • They decide on at least two or three finalists, including the trim levels and optional equipment they’d like on each. They pick their first-choice vehicle and at least one attractive fallback alternative, based on both emotional appeal and rational analysis. • Next, they find the dealer invoice cost for those vehicles and gather any available information on current factory-to-dealer incentives, as a basis from which to negotiate a purchase price confidently and aggressively. They also bone up on any direct consumer incentives being offered by the manufacturers. • With solid knowledge of the wholesale and retail values of their current cars and the best financing they can arrange independently, they plan an aggressive approach that will get several car stores to bid competitively for their business. • They understand the potential value of proper timing, in relation to both incentive programs and dealer sales targets, and they plan their approach accordingly. • They understand the ways car stores try to boost their profits, including all the high-cost/low-value add-on options they’ll try to sell, and they are ready to handle them. • Finally, they go into the negotiating process determined to let the guys at the car store do the stewing. They know that those guys need us more than we need them.

There’s another reason why that Toyota dealership wanted that car. Remember, dealers sell about as many used cars as new each year, and they make more profit doing it. But most people buying a new Toyota, if they have anything to trade in, are trading either another nameplate or an older Toyota that belongs on an independent used-car lot.

Today, most folks start with the Internet when researching used-car prices. The publishers of those used-car pricing books have web sites where they provide estimates of both trade-in/wholesale and market/retail used-car values. The best-known sites are Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com), Edmunds (www.edmunds.com), and the National Automobile Dealer Association (www.nadaguides.com). But don’t take these numbers too seriously. You will often find substantial differences between these sources, which suggests that there may be no “right” number for your car. That’s not surprising, since every used car is unique, based on its age, mileage, and condition. More important, these sites don’t necessarily reflect the current wholesale climate for your car in your market. Local conditions always affect values. For example, there’s a town in Oregon where almost everyone drives a pickup, so there’s always a glut of used trucks on the market there. But take the same truck 40 miles down the road to a larger, more-urban market and it’s worth $1,500 to $2,000 more. There’s no way to learn that from any web site.

Your answer to his question will depend on the “value ball park” your car is in.

• Add the fact that your monthly payments will include more interest than principal until you get into the latter part of the payment schedule, and you can see how a car’s value can go down much faster than your equity in it goes up. This fact leaves you exposed to significant loss if your car is stolen or destroyed in an accident. Your insurance company will pay you the car’s depreciated market value, but you may owe the bank or finance company much more. If you are unwilling to accept this risk, ask the lender about gap insurance, which covers the difference between the car’s insured value and the amount you owe. This insurance could cost several hundred dollars over the term of the loan.

Virtually all automotive information sources we’ve seen imply that it’s possible to learn the dealer’s true “dead cost” for any vehicle. You need to understand from the outset that that’s not true. Only the owner of each dealership knows his or her real dead cost. That’s because there are several nontraditional ways that auto manufacturers are putting cash in dealers’ pockets today that are not reported anywhere and that no one, on or off the Internet, can tell you about. We will describe these kinds of programs later in this chapter.

The dealer invoice price is the actual price billed by the factory, the “invoice” the dealer must pay when the vehicle is delivered to his lot. (Typically, the dealer pays the manufacturer with money he borrows under his “flooring plan” credit arrangement with a bank or finance company or with the auto manufacturer’s finance subsidiary. He pays the lender interest until the car is sold, then repays the loan.)

The second piece of this cost puzzle is called “dealer holdback,” and no one talks about it. It’s something no dealer wants you to know. Chances are, dealers don’t even discuss it with their salesmen because it’s the last thing they want them thinking about. For most makes, both domestics and imports, holdback is one of the most significant ways manufacturers put money back into dealers’ pockets. It is not an incentive, and it applies to every vehicle sold with that nameplate. Holdback is a specific percentage of a vehicle’s price that is built into the original factory invoice price the dealer pays, held back by the manufacturer for awhile, and then credited back to the dealer’s account after the vehicles are sold, typically quarterly. For example, GM and Chrysler each hold back an amount equal to 3 percent of the total retail sticker price (the manufacturers’ suggested retail price [MSRP]), excluding the destination charge. While this percentage may seem relatively small, the dollars involved can be significant because even a midpriced new vehicle costs so much today.

• All GM and Chrysler nameplates hold back 3 percent of the full sticker price (MSRP), excluding the destination charge. • All Ford nameplates except Lincoln hold back 3 percent of the full sticker price (MSRP), excluding the destination charge. Lincoln’s holdback is 2 percent of the full sticker price (MSRP), excluding the destination charge. In addition, the Ford Motor Corporation has certification programs in which top-rated dealers earn extra holdback dollars. Top-rated Ford “Blue Oval” dealers and Mercury “Advantage” dealers receive additional holdback of 1.25 percent of the sticker price (MSRP), excluding the destination charge. And top-rated Lincoln “Premier” dealers get an extra 2.5 percent of the sticker price, excluding the destination charge. • Isuzu, Saab, Subaru, and Volkswagen hold back 3 percent of the full sticker price (MSRP). Isuzu also gives dealers another 1 percent of the total MSRP as a “floor planning allowance” to help pay interest carrying charges on their inventory. • Others hold back a percentage of the base sticker price (MSRP), excluding the destination charge and the price of any additional option packages and accessories. Honda’s holdback is 3 percent of the base sticker price. Lexus, Mazda, and Suzuki hold back 2 percent of the base MSRP.

As noted above, the first element determining the dealer’s “dead cost” for your vehicle is the dealer invoice price, and the second is dealer holdback. There’s a third and final piece to this puzzle, but this is where the trail gets difficult to track because we can’t see all the footprints. Have you ever watched late-night television and wondered how so many dealers can shout about “prices below dealer invoice,” implying that they’re selling them for less than they paid? What they’re trying to do, in dealer jargon, is “create a sense of urgency” that will get you off your couch and into their showrooms. The best way to do that, apparently, is to convince you that they’re almost giving those things away. But how can dealers sell cars and trucks for less than they cost? The answer, of course, is that they can’t. At least they can’t for long and stay in business, and who wants to buy a car from a dealer who’s about to go out of business? So, when they spend all those ad dollars implying that that’s what they’re doing, are they telling us less than the whole truth, or even misleading us? The answer lies somewhere between yes and no. Yes, because a dealer can sell cars all day long for less than he paid for them and still make money. And no, he can’t sell cars for less than they cost him without losing money. Yes, the dealer invoice cost is what he paid for the car. It’s the bill he got from the manufacturer, the invoice he had to pay when the auto arrived. But what he paid for the car is not what it ends up costing him, because there are several ways manufacturers put money back into his pocket through factory-to-dealer incentive programs. There are two classes of factory-to-dealer incentives: traditional dealer cash and what we will call undisclosed incentives—undisclosed to everyone except individual dealers. Traditional Dealer Cash—In these programs, automakers give dealers a specific cash payment for every vehicle sold within a given time period. Most of the time there will be either a customer incentive or a dealer incentive; in rare instances, a vehicle may have both. Sometimes, these incentives are advertised, but often they are not. It is usually possible to learn about these traditional dealer cash offers through published incentive reports.

Undisclosed Dealer Cash—This is where the hunt for the true dead cost of your car hits a wall. Because today virtually all automakers are rewarding dealers in ways that aren’t revealed outside the dealer community—ways other than holdback and traditional “sell one, get $XXX” sales incentives. Most of these programs are tailored to objectives set for each individual dealership and are not tied directly to your transaction. And no source can report them because they will differ from one dealer to another, depending on a dealership’s performance against its targets. Think about it this way. Assume you owned a store selling television sets and everyone who walked in knew exactly what you paid for them and used that information to get you to sell for little or no profit. Surely, you’d eventually go to Sony, Toshiba, and Mitsubishi and say, “We’re getting killed here. You’d better find other ways to put money in our pockets, or you won’t have retail stores to sell your products.” That’s what’s been happening in the retail automobile business. Here’s how a couple of these programs work:

- Highlight Loc. 2409-18  | Added on Friday, March 18, 2011, 12:37 AM

BMW has no holdback and Volvo’s holdback is just 1 percent of the base sticker price (MSRP). But their dealers can earn additional cash incentives approaching $1,000 or more for every car sold by reaching their individual customer satisfaction index targets, based on questionnaire responses from both sales and service customers. Of course, there’s no way for anyone to know whether any given dealership is earning $1,000, $500, $100, or nothing. We believe other manufacturers are motivating dealers in similar ways to improve the way they treat customers, but no one can attach a dollar figure to any individual dealer. In another incentive format, automakers set specific sales targets for each dealer, stretching over several weeks or months, and they’ll pay an additional $XXX per vehicle if the dealer beats the target by X percent, $YYY if he beats it by Y percent, and $ZZZ if he beats it by Z percent. These targets may include all cars or be geared to specific product segments, such as sport utility vehicles. Again, there’s no way to know where any dealer stands vs. his target, so there’s no specific dollar number we could use as a negotiating chip even if we knew a program like this existed.

No report picks up every incentive offer. Many automakers don’t run the same incentives everywhere, because they gear them to the needs of each market. There are always regional offers that you wouldn’t learn about or be affected by unless you lived in those markets. The available reports, including CarDeals, have long-standing, reliable sources, including many dealers. But there may be one deal in Hartford and another in New Haven. No single report blankets this country with enough spies to ferret out all the different regional and local rebate, dealer cash, and low-cost financing offers.

Some automakers avoid traditional incentives like the plague because they believe they damage the brand image. As an example, we seldom see rebates or dealer cash on current Honda models, though the company has used model-year-end dealer cash offers to move out last year’s cars. The strategic thinking is that it’s crazy to spend $500 million on advertising to convince us to buy their cars because they’re so wonderful, then spend another $300 million to convince us to buy them because they’re so cheap. The company believes those actions work at cross-purposes, and it’s right.

Does that mean Honda doesn’t occasionally spend promotional dollars to boost sales of certain models? Of course not. But instead of offering rebates, the company will put that incentive money into subsidized financing for purchases or leases through its captive finance company, Honda Motor Credit Corporation. For example, Honda might spend $1,000 to offer five-year financing at a rate that’s well below the market interest rate, saving the customer at least $1,000 in interest charges over the term of the loan. Why will Honda do that, but not offer a $1,000 rebate? Because the average consumer doesn’t perceive a cut in the interest rate as a cut in the price of the car, so the brand’s image doesn’t suffer.

SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON INCENTIVES Okay, so we can’t get perfect information on incentives that will reveal the dealer’s dead cost. But there are sources that can tell us much of what we want to know, and we should use them. • Many Internet web sites provide incentive data. Among them: Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com) and Intellichoice (www.intellichoice.com). We’ve found that the best site is Edmunds (www.edmunds.com), which seems to do a better job of turning up traditional dealer cash incentives. Edmunds also provides incentives by zip code, but that information isn’t always correct. And these Internet sources frequently don’t agree with each other. • Automotive News, the industry’s trade paper, publishes a weekly listing of national customer and dealer cash incentives. It may be available in your local library. • The biweekly CarDeals report that’s included in our Fighting Chance information package is the best hard-copy publication we’ve found. It covers the national customer and traditional dealer cash incentives well, typically listing many more offers than Automotive News. (You can view a sample of a typical CarDeals report in a portable document file [PDF] format on our web site, www.fightingchance.com.) • Believe it or not, the best information sources for customer incentives in your market are probably the dealers there who sell the nameplates you’re shopping. Since the automakers pay the costs of these offers, they should readily disclose them to you. Call two or three local dealers, ask to speak to the finance manager, tell him you’re considering one of the vehicles his dealership sells, and ask him what customer rebates, special financing, or leasing programs the manufacturer is offering on that car.

Document Processing Fees Many dealers will charge a documentation fee. Of course, they can’t sell anyone a car without processing some documents and sending messengers with paperwork to and from your state’s motor vehicle department. You could argue that’s their cost of doing business, not yours. Frankly, it’s not worth much of an argument unless the fee is unreasonably high. We won’t dig in our heels over $25 to $50. But sometimes this fee is several hundred dollars. In this situation, consider this number in the context of the rest of the deal. If you’re buying the car for ten cents over the dealer invoice, or well below the invoice, then figure that all but about $50 of that charge is profit, and maybe it’s okay if they make a buck or two on your $20,000 purchase. But if they’re getting a decent profit, then want several hundred dollars to process documents, ask for a job there processing documents.

• Both traditional and undisclosed dealer cash incentive programs may stretch over two or more months, but they are geared to finish at the end of a month. A dealer may need to sell just a few more cars to reach one of those secret sales plateaus that will give him more money on all the other cars sold during the promotion period. In that situation, he may be willing to sell those cars for prices well below his actual cost. This makes the end of the month the best time to buy. If your old car just died or was totaled in an accident, you may need to move sooner. But if this is not the case, don’t even think about negotiating before the last few days of the month.

If it’s late in the fall, remember that dealers also have yearly sales goals. Some of the smartest shoppers always buy their new cars during the last few days of December, between Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Dealers can get very aggressive then, hoping to punctuate the end of the year with a big sales flourish.

Many people like to buy at the end of the model year, during those yearend closeout sales. The new models are about to arrive, and they’ve got to make space for them. (For the purpose of measuring sales, the industry designates October through September as its model year.) One reason prices are friendlier at the end of the model year is that most automakers allocate money to help their dealers sell those year-end leftovers.

In the past, two automakers, General Motors (GM) and Ford, regularly provided a “carryover allowance” to move out year-end leftovers. That allowance was 5 percent of the sticker price (the manufacturers’ suggested retail price), which they credited to dealers for every previous year’s vehicle sold after the new model of the same vehicle arrived in the showroom. On a vehicle with a $20,000 sticker price, that 5 percent represented an additional $1,000 for you to bargain for. The allowance generally covered all vehicles, but sometimes it excluded hot-selling models in relatively short supply, especially if the new models had only minor changes. But in recent years, carryover has been dropped by GM and Ford. Now they simply put much higher incentives on year-end models, as other automakers do. A Key Closeout Issue: Slim Pickings One problem with waiting until the end of the model year to shop for your dream car is that you may not be able to find it then. Most automakers stop assembling the current year’s models in June and start producing the next year’s models in July, to be shipped after Labor Day. As a result, you may have trouble locating the particular color-and-equipment combination you want, especially if new car sales have been strong.

Sometimes year-end pickings can be slim in a down market. If sales have been depressed for months, both manufacturers and their dealers may write off a model year when it’s only half over. Dealers get very selective with their orders as the current year’s production winds down, and the factories structure their build-out plans to allow dealers to maintain lean inventories of only the fastest-moving models. They’re both hoping to end the old-model year without a glut of leftovers, so they can focus all their resources on the new-model launch in the fall. If you plan to shop for an end-of-year bargain, you’ll have more to choose from if there are two or three finalists you’d be equally happy to drive home. If you’ve got your heart set on one model, try to have an open mind on color and equipment.

Another issue to consider is the year-to-year inflation in auto prices. Buying last year’s leftover makes more sense when prices are increasing 5 percent or more a year ($1,000 or more on a $20,000 car) than when yearly price hikes are just 1 or 2 percent. The dollar-yen relationship plays a major role in this. When the yen is surging against the dollar, as it did in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Japanese repatriate fewer and fewer yen for each dollar earned here, so they have to raise prices continuously just to stay even.

In making this decision, your reference point should be the most current model, not the leftover. First determine what you’d have to pay for the new one; then see how much you can save by buying last year’s version. Our rough rule of thumb: On any midpriced car, if you can’t save at least $1,500 by buying the leftover, it’s usually smarter to buy the newer model—unless you plan to drive it until it’s virtually worthless.

Here’s how to estimate how long a car has been in a dealer’s inventory. Look for the federally mandated manufacturer’s sticker or plate, which shows the month and year of manufacture. It also carries these words: “This vehicle conforms to all applicable federal motor vehicle safety, bumper and theft prevention standards in effect on the date of manufacture shown above.” It’s usually placed inside the jamb of the driver’s door, but may also be under the hood—on the fire wall between the engine and passenger compartments—or on one of the wheel wells. If the date of manufacture is more than four months ago, you may assume the dealer is particularly anxious to sell that vehicle and might accept a lower price than he would for a car that just arrived on his lot.

How the Fax Attack Works Faxing works for any vehicle in good supply, whether you’re buying or leasing. It’s equally effective at the $70,000 luxury level, as well as at the $10,000 entry level. If you fax fifteen to twenty dealers, you’ll usually get responses from about half of them, much of it within the first few hours. And you’ll be sitting in the comfort of your home or office while they play your game, instead of in the discomfort of a car store, playing their game. The fax attack tends to separate out the dealers who will make better deals at that time. Some want to sell in quantity; others want to maximize the profit per sale. Dealers move in and out of these classifications, depending on market conditions and their current sales, inventory, and incentive positions. There are no dealers who always give the best or worst deals. The dealer who will give you the best deal this week may offer the worst deal or not even participate in the bidding next week because his situation has changed.

There is also anecdotal evidence that Honda dealers get rewarded for making customers happy. Two examples: • A Fighting Chance customer who bought an Accord for $151 below invoice reported: “The dealership had the #1 CSI ranking in Northern California and they wanted to keep it. I used another dealer’s low bid from the ‘fax attack’ as a negotiating tool, and this dealer went $250 below that number, asking only that I give his dealership a 100% rating on the CSI survey. He was ready to sell at almost any price to keep that #1 CSI rating!” • Another customer negotiated a similar Accord deal at a different dealership. But as she was signing the paperwork in the finance manager’s office, he tried to pressure her into buying everything from an extended warranty to credit life insurance. That experience was so unpleasant that she gave the dealership low marks on the questionnaire she received by mail a month later. Ten days later, she got an angry phone call from the sales manager at the dealership saying, “We gave you a great deal, why did you do that to us?” She told him, of course. The relevant question here is, “Why would the sales manager make that angry call if her poor rating on that questionnaire didn’t cost his dealership something it wanted?” Maybe it was money, maybe a better allocation of hot-selling new vehicles. If Honda uses secret dealer incentives like these, it’s safe to assume that most other automakers do. The fax attack is a powerful negotiating tool that encourages dealers to include this cash in their price proposals.

The fax attack is a five-step process over a two-to three-day period: (1) identifying the people you’ll contact; (2) preparing and sending the fax; (3) fielding the responses; (4) getting back to the participants after all the bids are in; and (5) finalizing the deal to avoid last-minute surprises. Identifying the Dealer Contacts Your objective should be to contact at least fifteen dealers. On average, about half will respond. Locating fifteen dealers near you is relatively easy if you’re shopping for a domestic nameplate, since most of them have 2,000 to 4,000 franchised stores.

If you’re shopping for a luxury nameplate, include dealerships in less-affluent surrounding markets or more remote areas of larger markets. They don’t see the fat-cat traffic that others do, and they delight in beating the big-city dealers out of a deal (For example, in southern California the deal is often better in hot-and-dusty Bakersfield or smoggy Riverside than in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Newport Beach, or La Jolla, where the high-rollers live.)

Will e-mailing work as well as faxing? Although many Fighting Chance customers have reported good results from an e-mail attack, we prefer faxing for two key reasons: (1) The best person to contact is the sales or fleet manager. Is he or she into e-mail? Maybe, maybe not. (To find out, ask for e-mail addresses when you call to ask for names.) (2) An e-mail approach may go to the Internet salesperson, who may have the authority to give you the same deal he or she gives everyone else, but no authority to go below that number.

But a deal isn’t a great deal until it’s a done deal. An online dealer may quote you a great price on the phone, as a way to get you into his store, then renege on the first price and charge much more.

When she got to the store to complete the deal, the sales manager told her the price would be $2,000 over invoice. We frequently hear stories like this about all kinds of referral services, not just those online.

The CSS believes that CarBargains frequently results in “the lowest price a dealer will allow,” simply because he perceives it as a one-shot, out-of-the-blue opportunity for an incremental sale that he wouldn’t normally get. CarBargains has performed very well in several consumer tests against other car-buying services—including those conducted by ABC News 20/20, Motor Trend, and Money magazine. Money reported, “We had correspondents in five cities comparison shop three Internet buyers (Auto-by-tel, AutoVantage and CarPoint) vs. CarBargains. The result: In nine out of ten comparisons, the lowest CarBargains bid beat the lowest Internet bid, even after adding the CarBargains service fee.”

THE PLACE TO LOOK IS IN THE MIRROR Leasing can make a lot of sense for some people and be a poor choice for others. Start by asking yourself these questions: • Do you like to trade cars with reasonable frequency, at least every three or four years? • Do you value the image you project by always driving a late-model vehicle? • Would you like to drive a more expensive car than you can afford to buy? Or would you like to drive the same car for a lower monthly payment? • Do you drive an average of less than 15,000 miles a year? • Would you rather take the cash you’d use for a down payment and put it into an investment that appreciates? • Conversely, are you someone who can afford to make the monthly payments but doesn’t have enough cash for a significant down payment? • Are you in the early part of your career and needing the reliability of a new car, but not yet able to afford the monthly payment required for a purchase? • Do you need one kind of vehicle now but know you’ll need another kind in two or three years? • Are you more intrigued with the concept of paying only for vehicle usage than with the psychic rewards some people get from vehicle ownership? • Would you like to always be driving a car that’s covered by the automaker’s initial bumper-to-bumper warranty? • Are you willing to make monthly car payments indefinitely? • Do you own a business that will be making those payments?

If you’re not a candidate for leasing, you’ll take comfort in the flip side of this fact: The average car loses 65 to 70 percent of its value in the first five years. As depressing as that is, it does say that the average car retains 30 to 35 percent of its value after five years … which is 30 to 35 percent more value than you’ll ever retain if you always lease your cars.

The Simple Concept Think of leasing as long-term car rental. When you sign a lease, you agree to make a specific monthly payment for a specific number of months in return for use of the car during that period. In lease language, you are the lessee, and the company that leases you the car is the lessor. The lessor is typically not a dealer but a separate financing company that buys the car from a dealer and then leases it to you. This could be one of hundreds of independent leasing companies, a national, regional, or local bank, or an auto manufacturer’s captive finance subsidiary, such as GMAC or Toyota Motor Credit Corporation. What You Pay For The monthly payments you make to the leasing company cover two basic elements: 1. You’re paying for the estimated depreciation in the vehicle’s value over the term of your lease. You’re not paying for the whole car; you’re paying only for the part of its value that you use. That’s why the monthly payment will be lower than a standard auto loan payment. 2. You’re paying an interest charge. Often called a lease fee or a lease rate, it’s the equivalent of a bank’s interest charges on an auto loan. You’re paying interest on the depreciation, which you are financing and paying off over the term of the lease, just as you would pay off the principal of a conventional car loan. You’re also paying interest on the balance of the car’s value—what it will be worth at the end of the lease term. That’s because the leasing company has to pay the dealer for the whole car, not just the depreciation. Otherwise, you couldn’t drive it home. In effect, you’re borrowing that lease-end value and driving it around for a few years.

Advance Payment Leases Some leases offer the option of a single large payment up front that covers all costs for the term of the lease, with no monthly payments thereafter. Such a payment avoids the interest charge for depreciation and prepays the interest on the residual value. These leases tend to be for luxury cars, probably because only luxury-car buyers can write a check that large.

Most automakers are offering lease terms of three to four years for three reasons: (1) the payments on a two-year lease are too high for most people; (2) lessees will be back relatively soon for another new car; and (3) dealers need a steady supply of off-lease cars with 36,000 to 50,000 miles on the odometer to support their profitable used-car business. What’s the best lease term for most people? One that’s no longer than the length of the original bumper-to-bumper factory warranty, so you’ll never have to face a big repair bill. Don’t sign a lease for a term that’s longer than you’re sure you’ll keep the car. Every lease has an “early termination clause,” and it’s a painful end to consider. Once you’ve signed that lease, you’ve agreed to pay a significant amount of money over several years. When you terminate early, you must pay the entire liability all at once. That will typically include: (a) a $250 to $400 disposition fee, (b) any past-due payments, (c) the remaining depreciation due under the lease, and, in some leases, (d) an early termination penalty. Add it all up, and the total may come close to the sum of all the remaining monthly lease payments.

Many auto manufacturers’ captive finance companies—such as GMAC, Ford Motor Credit Corporation, and Nissan Motors Acceptance Corporation—shield their customers from losses if a leased vehicle is stolen or wrecked, paying any difference between the insurance payoff and the lease balance and allowing the customer to get a new car. To cover potential losses, they provide their own gap insurance, either by self-insuring or by paying a modest premium for each vehicle leased (probably under $50 per vehicle). They build this cost into your monthly payment. Whether you’re leasing from one of the captive companies or from an independent leasing outfit, you should ask about and get gap insurance. If it’s not built into the lease agreement, treat it as a bargaining point and ask the company to provide it at no cost. (They may not agree, but it’s worth a try.) Gap insurance shouldn’t add more than a few dollars to your monthly lease payment. For example, a credit union in California charges only $102 for a policy covering a three-year lease term.

Sales Taxes Most states treat leasing like any other purchase and tax the total amount of your payments, including the interest portion. But there are exceptions. Some states tax the entire capitalized cost, as if you were purchasing the vehicle. Among them are Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas. The total tax is often due at the commencement of the lease, meaning the lessor must pay it and either collect it from you up front or roll it into your lease. Each state has its own definition of what is included in the agreed upon price of the car, and at least one (Kentucky) defines the gross purchase price for tax purposes as 90 percent of the sticker price. A few states have hybrid taxation schemes that combine elements of the alternatives covered above. In Maine, for example, the entire tax is due at the time of inception, but the amount is calculated based on the sum of all monthly payments. In Vermont and New Jersey, a tax is imposed up front on the difference between the adjusted capitalized cost and the residual value, so you don’t pay tax on the interest or “rent” charges.

It’s not unusual for different vehicles of the same make to have very different residual value percentages and interest rates, depending on how aggressively automakers are pushing certain models in specific time periods. They usually don’t need lease subsidies to sell the most popular products, but when the market is soft you might find special lease deals on almost any vehicle. Manufacturers’ different lease incentive programs can come and go like the wind, and tracking them all would be impossible. We know of no reliable source of information on current offerings, but many of them are advertised in newspapers. (Note: The factory-subsidized lease deals are available only through the manufacturer’s financing arm, not through independent banks and leasing companies.)

The industry’s “bible” for residual values is the Automotive Lease Guide’s Residual Percentage Guide. Published bimonthly, this guide lists each vehicle’s estimated wholesale value, as a percentage of the original sticker price, after two, three, four, and five years. These estimates assume that you won’t buy the car when the lease ends, and that the leasing company will sell it to dealers at an auction.

Now let’s assume you’ve negotiated a transaction price of $20,000 on a car with a $22,000 sticker price, and that the car’s residual value after three years will be $10,000. If you were to buy it and finance the whole purchase, part of each payment would pay off the $20,000 principal, and the rest would pay interest on the loan. You’d owe $20,000 at the beginning and nothing at the end. When you lease, you still pay interest on the whole amount because the financing entity (the leasing company) has put up $20,000 to buy the car from the dealer. But unlike a conventional auto loan, the only “principal” you pay off is the $10,000 of depreciation—the difference between the capitalized cost of $20,000 (your negotiated price) and the residual value of $10,000. You don’t “pay off” that residual value, but you pay interest on it because you’re borrowing it and driving it around for the term of the lease. Now let’s do the arithmetic, assuming a 36-month lease with a 7.5 percent interest rate. We’ll do it using the constant yield method, which is used by all major leasing companies except Ford Motor Credit. This isn’t brain surgery, but it’s different, so stay awake. • Figure the monthly depreciation charge. Divide the $10,000 depreciation by 36 months to get $277.78. • Determine the monthly finance charge. Add the $20,000 capitalized cost to the $10,000 residual value. Multiply that $30,000 by .003125 (the money factor, figured by dividing .075 by 24) to get $93.75. It appears that we’re double-counting the residual value, but we’re not. The money factor has a built-in assumption that everything gets paid off, like the principal of a conventional car loan, so it cuts everything in half—assuming that on average, the outstanding “principal” is half of the total. That works for the depreciation, since you pay it off over the term of the lease. But you don’t pay off any of the residual value. So you must double it before you apply the money factor, which brings it back to its original value. • Add the $277.78 depreciation and the $93.75 interest, for a total monthly lease payment of $371.53. Plus tax. To calculate the effect of making a down payment, or “cap reduction,” just reduce the capitalized cost by the amount of the payment and do the arithmetic again. That’s it. Knowing this relatively simple calculation can be very empowering. With it, you can easily “solve” for any of the three factors if you know the other two. Since you negotiate the capitalized cost, and the residual value is stated in the lease agreement, the only missing factor is usually the interest rate. Dealers are not required to disclose this rate, or the money factor, though many will do so when they understand that you can perform this simple calculation.

If you don’t want the hassle of writing a check every month and can afford to write one very large check, you might consider the alternative of a single-payment lease. This will save you some interest expense, maybe a lot. When you write that one big check, you’ll avoid paying interest on the depreciation, since you’ll be paying the entire depreciation charge up front, instead of paying it month by month. You’ll still pay interest on the residual value, since you’re borrowing it and driving it around for the lease term. But you might negotiate a somewhat lower interest rate because you’ll pay all the interest on day one, instead of in monthly installments.

Rule 1: Lease Early in the Model Year Timing can be as important in leasing as in buying, and the right time to lease in some instances is early in the model year. You usually get a better lease deal then, for two key reasons: 1. Most auto manufacturers have at least one price increase during the model year. Some have several. If you lease after an increase, you’ll have a higher capitalized cost, which means a higher monthly payment. 2. The later it gets in the model year, the closer you’ll come to leasing a car that will be four years old in only 36 months. The numbers go down a little with each bimonthly issue of the Automotive Lease Guide’s Residual Percentage Guide. Unless the automaker is subsidizing the lease to offset this shrinking value, the leasing company will establish a lower residual value as the model year progresses, which will require a higher monthly payment. This can become a very significant issue if you’re considering leasing last year’s model after this year’s model has arrived. Without big manufacturer subsidies, it will actually cost you more to lease the older model. So if it’s July, August, or September, it may pay to wait until October, November, or December and lease next year’s model. The caveat: If the manufacturer is aggressively subsidizing the lease, it doesn’t matter where you are in the model year, and this rule doesn’t apply.

Rule 3: You Can Often Beat the Numbers in Lease Promotion Ads You will periodically see ads promoting factory-subsidized leases, where the manufacturer has allocated money to inflate the residual value and/or lower the money factor, either of which will reduce the lease payment. In preparing those ads, the automakers must assume a negotiated price of the car that’s high enough to avoid angering dealers. Chances are, you can negotiate a lower price by making dealers bid competitively and end up with a lower monthly payment than that featured in the advertising.

BASIC WARRANTIES ARE NOW CLOSE TO PARITY The old standard bumper-to-bumper warranty of one year or 12,000 miles (whichever comes first) is a thing of the past, thanks to Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. The Japanese Big Three provide a basic warranty of 3 years or 36,000 miles, and starting with the 1992 models, Detroit’s Big Three finally matched their key competitors. (Ford and Chrysler maintained the ancient 12-month/ 12,000-mile warranty on most vehicles through the 1991 model year.) The basic bumper-to-bumper warranty covers most parts of the car. An additional powertrain warranty covers the things that make the car go (the engine, transmission, and drivetrain), frequently for a longer period than the basic warranty. And a longer corrosion warranty covers actual holes in the body caused by rust. Separate warranties cover the battery, tires, emission control system, and accessory items you may add to the vehicle. There are no warranties covering parts that must be replaced owing to normal wear, such as brake pads, clutch linings, lightbulbs and fuses, wiper blades, filters, and so on.

What they won’t tell you is that this $1,000+ extended coverage contract costs them only about 50 cents on the asking-price dollar. This is one of the highest-margin items a car store sells. And most car stores would rather sell it and make a $100 or $200 profit than not sell it and make nothing. To get the best price, you have to make the negotiation as competitive as that for the car itself. The place to start is with the dealers who want to sell you the car.

It covers all mechanical parts of the car except for maintenance and wear-and-tear items. To add this coverage, you must have a car that’s less than 11 months old and an odometer reading of less than 11,000 miles. Added advantage: You don’t have to spend extra money up front for an extended warranty. MBI coverage becomes part of your GEICO auto insurance policy.

MAKE THIS A DAY GAME … ON A NICE DAY You can’t inspect a new vehicle properly in the dark or in the rain. Put the trip off until you can do it in broad daylight on a reasonably nice day. Take a friend or relative to help; four eyes and ears are better than two. Carry a pad and make a list of any problems you discover. Here are the things you should do on your inspection trip: 1. Check the odometer. If it shows more than about 300 miles, the dealer better have a good explanation. (Maybe he made an exchange with a dealer 200 miles away. But maybe he’s trying to slip you a demonstrator that someone’s been driving for a few weeks.) 2. Make sure all the optional equipment you ordered is on the car. Then have the salesman take you through the operation of all the equipment. The air conditioner, cruise control, lights, sliding sunroof, stereo system (the basics only for now), electric windows, washer-wipers, remote side mirrors, remote fuel cap opener … everything. Make sure it all works. (Incidentally, this is part of his job.) 3. Use your accomplice to help check all the lights. The turn signals, backup lights and brake lights, dome light and other interior lighting, even the glove compartment, trunk, and engine light (if there is one). Ask whether the manufacturer has set the interior lights to go on briefly when you leave the car at night, and if so, how long they stay on. 4. Go over the interior fabric areas very carefully. On cloth areas, make sure that the fit is perfect everywhere, and that there are no stains or tears. Ditto for the carpets and the headliner (the cloth or plastic covering between your head and the roof), which should show no sloppy glue stains. 5. Pay close attention to the exterior finish, both body and chrome. It should be perfect, without scratches or dents. (New-car owners should be allowed to put the first dings in their own doors.) If there are small scratches, they can be buffed out without too much difficulty. But if the scratches are long enough and deep enough to require repainting, you should refuse the car, period! The original factory finish is very difficult for even the best body shop to match, and partial-panel matching is next to impossible. The body shop would probably end up repainting the whole side or panel to fix a small imperfection, and chances are, you’d be unhappy with the result. 6. Check for previous body damage. It’s rare with new cars, but it happens—on test drives or in transporting dealer exchanges. Look for mismatched paint on adjacent body parts or ripples in the surface. (Federal law says the buyer must be given a disclosure statement on previous damage.) 7. Check the fit and finish on all things that open and close. Windows, passenger doors, hood, trunk, glove box—and make sure all the tires match. 8. While the hood is up, ask the salesman to show you where all the fluids go and how to use the dipsticks to check the levels. The engine oil. The brake fluid. The automatic transmission fluid. The power steering fluid. The radiator anti-freeze, and even the windshield washing solution. If any of these is not at the proper level, either the dealer has done a poor job of prepping the car or there’s a leak. 9. Most important, take the car for a test drive, ideally while the dealer’s tags are still on it, not with temporary or permanent tags assigned to you. That way it’s still under his insurance coverage, and he can’t claim you’ve taken delivery. Drive the car reasonably aggressively to test it. If it’s an automatic transmission, do the gears seem to shift smoothly and at natural progression points? Does the cruise control work? Accelerate to about 30 mph on a straight, flat, dry road with little or no traffic, and take your hands off the wheel. If the vehicle pulls left or right, it may have alignment problems. Slam on the brakes. Does it stop squarely? And find a road with some bumps to drive over to see if there are any annoying squeaks and rattles. The dealer won’t love you for all this, but you will. Give your list of problems to him to copy (keep the original yourself), and tell him you’ll come back after he calls to say he’s fixed everything. At that time, examine the car again and, if it’s perfect, turn over the final check, sign the delivery receipt, and drive it off into the sunset. An important detail: Be sure you’ve communicated with your insurance agent, so that you’re covered the moment the wheels hit the street in front of the dealership. One last word to the wise: If you’re financing the car, don’t drive it home if the loan documents have not been approved and signed by the lender. More than one buyer has done that, then learned a week or two later that because of a problem with the credit application, the interest rate (and the monthly payment) would be much higher.

(Remember, a higher trim level often represents a better value because it includes standard equipment in the base price that would be extra-cost items in a lower trim level.)

OUR BIG PICTURE ANALYSIS—A POWERFUL NEGOTIATING TOOL As we noted in chapter 15, there is real power in knowing how the makes and models you are interested in are doing in the marketplace. That’s why each Fighting Chance package includes “The Big Picture,” our model-by-model analysis of the current sales and inventory status for each nameplate on your list. Updated bimonthly, this report enables you to gauge the relative sales strength of different vehicles and determine which are likely to be more flexible on price. You’ll also learn whether the average dealer sells 30 of your model every month or just 1 or 2. We’ll tell you if there are major changes in the design of your vehicle scheduled for the next model year. And if there have been changes in a manufacturer’s holdback policy, we include the latest information in this summary.

The books we’ve read on the subject seem to do a poor job of focusing the buyer on the best used-car options. Maybe that’s because they’re trying to talk to everyone, right down to the person with only $2,000 to spend who will end up with a 10-year-old car with over 120,000 miles on the odometer. This chapter is not for everyone. It’s for people who are seriously considering a new vehicle but have a strong left-brain orientation and wonder whether a previously owned vehicle would be a smarter buy. (If your left brain could talk, it would say, “Nobody needs a brand-new car to get from A to B.”) These folks understand that every new car becomes a used car very quickly, and that in a sense we’re all really driving used cars—it’s just a matter of timing. They also know that when it comes to cars and humans, there’s more than a dime’s worth of difference between “used” and “used up.”

There’s a strong dollars-and-sense argument for used over new, especially if you’re a relatively young person convinced that you’ll live forever but concerned that Social Security won’t. If you’re in your twenties or early thirties, the slam-dunk way for you to put an extra $300,000 into your retirement kitty is simply to decide never to buy a new car. Instead, every four years, buy a two-year-old car. Let that first driver take the big depreciation hit. (The average car’s wholesale value drops to 45–55 percent of its original sticker price in two years.) On a car with a sticker price of twenty to thirty grand, you’ll save a thousand or two a year. For the rest of your life.

Most late-model cars from wholesale auctions fall into four categories: 1. Some are excellent cars coming off leases to private individuals, mostly those that dealers decided not to buy at lease-end because the residual values were too high. These cars sell for significantly less at auction. 2. Others come to the auctions from daily rental company fleets. These are typically less than two years old and have high mileage for their age. They are frequently called “program cars” because they’re programmed to leave the rental fleet at a certain age and mileage. 3. Some are finance company repossessions from buyers who failed to make the required payments. 4. And some are refugees from corporate auto fleets. These can be high-mileage, high-wear-and-tear vehicles that have been poorly maintained. They can also be attractive lower-mileage cars driven by auto company executives.

What About Those Chains of Used-Car Superstores? You’re less likely to find the car of your dreams there. What you will find are a lot of cars from daily rental fleets and auctions at “no-dicker” prices. These stores don’t get to buy the best cars leased through an automaker’s captive finance company; the manufacturer’s franchised new-car dealers get first crack at those. Superstores like CarMax do, however, get cars from leases financed by third-party lenders, as well as from individuals. These no-dicker used-car superstores are good places to shop prices, but we think your local new-car dealer will have better late-model used cars. You may pay less there, too, because the prices will be negotiable. (See the research findings on comparative transaction prices in chapter 14.)

How Can You Tell Where a Late-Model Used Car Has Been? For openers, the dealer who bought it has the previous title document, so he knows where it came from. Ask for the car’s history, in writing; if he won’t give it to you, that’s a signal that he has something to hide and you should buy from someone else. And don’t sign a “power of attorney” form when you buy a used car. That enables a dealer to process the title transfer papers without showing you the certificate of title.

GIVE THAT CAR A COMPLETE PHYSICAL Have a mechanic look before you leap. When you find a car you’re serious about buying, any offer you make should be contingent on the vehicle passing a thorough inspection by an independent mechanic, ideally one who knows the model well. The service department of another dealership that sells the same make would be a good choice. Tell them exactly what you’re doing, and make it clear that you don’t own the car and won’t buy it if it has mechanical problems. That will eliminate any incentive for them to recommend unnecessary repairs. Many dealers will do a thorough used-car inspection for $50 to $150. This should include a compression test on all cylinders, a body integrity check for accident damage, a brake inspection, and checks of the front wheel bearings and suspension system, the transmission, and the exhaust, cooling, and electrical systems. Ask them to road-test the car for you. And get a cost estimate for any repairs they recommend. This may seem to be overkill for a nearly new car with plenty of its original bumper-to-bumper warranty remaining, but it’s not. If it’s a car headed for mechanical trouble, you don’t want it. If the selling dealer won’t let the car off his lot for an inspection, and if you can’t find one of those traveling inspection outfits that will do it there, find another dealer.

So What’s the Right Price for a Demo? The dealership has driven significant value off the vehicle; it must compensate the buyer for those miles. Our rough rule of thumb is 25 to 30 cents per mile—$1,500 to $1,800 on a car driven 6,000 miles. Why? Because 10 or 15 cents isn’t enough, and they’d never agree to anything like 50 cents. (If it had 20,000 miles, you wouldn’t get a $10,000 price reduction.) Assuming you could buy an “unused” version of the same model for $500 over invoice, you’d want to pay $1,500 to $1,800 less—or $1,000 to $1,300 below invoice—for one with 6,000 miles.

USED CARS ARE FOR LEASING, TOO If you’re a candidate to lease, you should consider leasing a used car. This alternative makes the most sense for someone who’d rather be driving a luxury or semiluxury car, but can’t afford a new one. You reference point should always be the cost of leasing the current model of the same car. After determining that number, check the cost of leasing a two-or three-year-old version. In most cases, you won’t save much by leasing a car that listed for under $20,000 when new. With all the subsidized new-car leases for vehicles in that price range, a used-car lease might save you only $20 a month. But leasing a three-year-old, factory-certified BMW 5-Series sedan might save you $200 a month compared to a new one.

Floor whores a.k.a. lot lizards. Just above the baitfish are the “floor whores,” salespeople who have survived by learning to pounce on the first person who walks in cold, without making an appointment. The floor whores aren’t liked by any sales personnel—they don’t work for their ups. But they are tolerated by any dealership because, even today, the vast majority of people who buy cars buy them from local dealerships without making appointments. So, the floor whores serve an important role in the food chain.   Geek masters. Smart dealerships aren’t simply using their regular sales force to close sales started on the Internet. They’ve learned that Web shoppers are often a different breed: interested in copies of invoices without an argument, not at all interested in being bounced around once they’ve arrived at the dealership, and more trusting of a shy bookworm than a stereotypical salesperson. That’s why sales forces are sprouting computer-friendly types carefully trained to look like order takers rather than salespersons. Are they easier to deal with? Definitely. Will you get a better deal from one? Seldom, if ever. The Geek masters practice sleight-of-hand better than the old guys, making their profits on silent add-ons and misdirection.   Specialists. “Specialty” sales personnel are even more important. Do you speak fluent Korean in a city with a large Korean population? Sign for the hearing impaired? Don’t mind dealing with persons with physical handicaps? Don’t mind catering to the gay community? Like to hang with military personnel? Specialty sales personnel, even rookies, have an easier time in the auto business because their particular skills aren’t easy to duplicate or replace.

The old-timers have dealt with every type of customer: the easy ones, the suspicious ones, and the crooked ones. They are professionals in the sense that years of selling have provided them a steady flow of repeat customers who have always dealt with them and always will. “You know,” an elegant and seasoned old salesman told me in San Francisco, “some people enjoy paying more.” These successful old guys have taken to the Web with a vengeance, too.   Salespeople don’t get much respect. Except for the likes of Killer, the “house” (the dealers) do their best to keep sales types from knowing about goodies like factory incentives, which generally make the bosses more money but not the sales force, or shower the bosses with fancy trips. Dealers don’t tell salespeople about “write downs,” used cars that have been lowered in value because of their condition or time on the lot. For years the dealers didn’t even tell their sales forces about “holdbacks,” extra profit built into each car invoice designed to look like extra cost. Now, everybody knows about holdbacks.

Or, rather, they pay 15-30 percent of the profit above the “pack.” What’s that? Let’s say the actual cost to the dealer of your average Expenso Gargantula is $16,500. But when the dealership’s title clerk prepares a computerized stock card on that car, the invoice price is coded as $17,000. This $500 “pack” added to “invoice price” is supposed to help the dealer pay his overhead. In reality, it’s just another way to keep from paying the salesperson his or her due. Many dealerships used to encourage their salespeople to show this pack figure to recalcitrant customers. “Here, Mr. Jones, that’s the actual cost of the car. If you will pay me a $400 profit over that figure, the car is yours.” Presto, the house has just made $900 rather than $400. Now that most dealerships claim they are putting actual invoice costs on their Web sites, “packs” are even harder to see, often because they are masked in other charges.

Inexperienced women buyers and older people. These groups are just two of salespeople’s favorite types of customers.

Innocence, enthusiasm, and a trusting nature make the selling process so simple.   Poor people. Have a slim pocket? Nice! Many poor people are also favorite targets because they tend to feel inferior or insecure the moment they walk on the lot. “What do these folks know about wheeling and dealing?” is the car salesman’s attitude. And then there are the people who think their credit is marginal (whether it actually is or not). If you’re one of these types, keep thinking negatively, please, and your salesman will sense that your main concern is not getting a good deal but getting financed. Car salespeople make much more money on you thanks to that insecurity.   The salesperson’s newest favorite target: computer geeks. Are you planning to buy on the Web because you feel safer there? Feel more in control? Do you believe the people and information on the Web just seem more reliable? Think the transaction seems simpler? Oops! You are a prime target for every Web site.

At monthly “pressure” times. Car salespersons are under two great pressures. One is the pressure of the dealer, who expects his salespeople and managers to sell every day. When business is slow—when it’s pouring down rain, for instance—the sales manager’s neck is under the guillotine, and you would be surprised how much money some people save. Sales personnel refer to rainy-day buyers as “fairies,” weird folk who only come out in the rain, invariably with a pad in hand. That’s okay, though. You can afford to put up with this contemptuous attitude for enough bucks, right? Another good time to buy a car can be the last few days of the month. Dealerships keep profit-and-loss statements on a monthly basis, and salespeople can get a little desperate toward the end of the month if forecasts aren’t being met. Even if the month has been a successful one, you will probably come out better—any deals made then are pure gravy. If you really want to be mean, go down to a dealership thirty minutes before closing time on a rainy night on the last day of the month. You’ll either get a really great deal or a really black eye.

Your warranties add to the importance of dealership location, too. Don’t think you can automatically buy a car far from home and then have it serviced at the dealership next door. Most cars are sold with two separate warranties. The “adjustment” warranty is usually for ninety days or so and includes problems such as squeaks and rattles, air leaks, and alignment. Since adjustment warranties are generally the responsibility of the selling dealer, the expense is paid by the selling dealer. Obviously, other dealers will not incur expenses for your selling dealer. Your car’s regular warranty has some restrictions, too. Generally, other dealerships are not required to honor regular warranty work if your selling dealer is located closer than fifty miles from the dealership at which you wish to have the work done. Some service departments will honor anyone’s warranty work, but don’t count on it. Warranty work, even regular warranty work, is relatively unprofitable for the dealer because most manufacturers limit the number of hours a dealer can charge for each specific repair. For instance, a manufacturer might allow only three hours for a mechanic to make a warranty repair on your transmission, even if the work takes four or five hours.

A few unknowns . . . • Manufacturers include in the base cost of their cars a charge for dealer preparation and handling. Many dealers will try to charge you for preparation again and will insist on adding an additional $100 or $200 to the list price of their vehicles. Don’t fall for it. • If you are considering a “leftover” new car (a new car left over from the previous model year), the dealer’s profit margin will usually be 3-5 percent more than the margin listed in the general pricing guides. Consumer Reports usually gives you the straight on these. • Automotive manufacturers periodically give their dealers other “incentives” on slower-moving cars. These are usually unadvertised bonuses to encourage dealers to lower their prices. Of course, they don’t, preferring to retain these bonuses as additional honey for the pot. You and I don’t know which cars may have these incentives either, but we can assume slow-moving, unpopular cars may have them. How do you know a slow-moving car? They usually receive the most sale advertising. • Don’t forget the normal dealer “holdback.” All new cars have an extra 2-4 percent profit built into their invoices. Neither you nor the salesperson ever sees this money, but remember it’s there when you begin to bargain.

Why go trekking through countless used-car lots or continually risk rear-end collisions trying to get close enough to read phone numbers on little red FOR SALE signs in the back window of speeding cars? Use the Web right and you can spend your extra time enjoying the latest copy of The Paris Review. The Web offers an easy, stress-free, and reasonably accurate way to locate specific used vehicles near you. It’s probably one of the best uses of the Internet this side of e-mail. And these tools are available at your library, even if you’re not Web savvy. We’ll give you lots of good advice on this in a minute. Whether or not you use the Web, lots of used-vehicle sources are accessible to you. The first two sources, in my opinion, are even better than online sources and certainly better than dealerships.

Remar’s First Choice: People You Know This is generally the safest and most overlooked used-car source. Do you have neighbors who trade regularly? All of us have friends who trade every two or three years. Wouldn’t it be better to consider offering that person more money for his vehicle than any dealership will give him? If you can find a friend or neighbor who is planning to trade, show him how to determine his vehicle’s true wholesale value (all a dealership would have given him for the vehicle; let him read chapter 6). Then offer him a profit. Both of you will be better off—your friend will receive more than wholesale, and you will acquire a nice, newer used vehicle with little or no hassle. Some smart used-vehicle buyers regularly buy the same person’s trade year after year. Could that make sense for you? You’ll still want to have this vehicle (any vehicle, regardless of the source) checked out by a mechanic or diagnostic center.   Second-Best: Bulletin Boards at Work Your chances of finding a nice car by reading those little notices posted on bulletin boards (or on your company’s Web site, or in your company’s credit union office) are just as good or better than your chances of finding a nice vehicle on some lot. Unfortunately, many people who attempt to sell their vehicles like this are in the bucket—they owe more on them than their actual value. But that’s the seller’s problem, not yours. Once you have agreed on the wholesale figure plus a fair profit, the seller is obligated to pay off his vehicle.

Third Choice: Used-Vehicle Sites on the Web I recommend that you use the Web as the third-best used-vehicle source—particularly if you want to find a very specific vehicle. For instance, if you must have a three-year-old white Toyota wagon with leather seats rather than any wagon in any color with any interior, the Web is your marketplace. Rope in a Web-wise friend to help you make this search, or head to the library, or rent Internet time at Kinko’s or a similar establishment.   The good, the bad, the very ugly online. The World Wide Web’s great power in the used-vehicle arena is twofold. First, it pulls together tens of thousands of small used-vehicle inventories into a few easily searchable inventories. Second, the Web allows individuals to enter the used-car arena, as either a seller or a buyer, without the murky involvement of commercial sellers. You can duel mano a mano with an individual without the overhead, inflated profit objectives, and deception of many professional sellers. This is the good.

Some examples of the types of sites you may wish to surf: • AutoTrader.com claims to list over 2.8 million vehicles from approximately 40,000 dealers and 250,000 private individuals. They have partnerships with other sites to provide used-car listings. Such sites include Yahoo! Autos, AOL, and Edmunds.com. • Autoweb.com, Car.com, and Autosite.com, three of Autobytel.com’s subsidiary sites, offer used-car listings from dealers and private individuals. • Cars.com is a site maintained by major newspaper chains and offers ads from dealers, individuals, and different media outlets. • Your local newspaper’s classifieds/Web site typically lists local ads from dealers and individuals.

Independent used-car dealers. Look for large lots that have been in business for years. Once you’ve found a few with nice selections, call your local Better Business Bureau. The bureau will tell you if complaints have been lodged against those particular lots. If the complaints have been numerous, either forget that lot or plan to have your mechanic check their vehicles twice. Many independent lots purchase virtually all of their vehicles from new-car dealers and “road hogs,” wholesalers who travel from city to city peddling individual vehicles. Such a vehicle may be a fine piece of merchandise, but shy away from it unless you can locate the previous owner. Road hogs make their living by taking dying vehicles from one market and giving them a new life in another.

Rental agencies. These people must have good public relations organizations working for them. Countless articles have praised them as the used-vehicle-buyer’s salvation. These articles enthusiastically tell you how helpful their selling procedures are and, of course, how rental car sellers pioneered the “one price” method of selling. The rental car company sellers are also fond of saying, “Our vehicles are cheaper because there are no middlemen. We already own the vehicles.” Incorrect. Rental agencies generally determine the true wholesale value of a vehicle and then add their profit to that figure, as all used-car sellers do. Rental agencies also tout their “twelve-month warranties.” It’s the same warranty offered at most used-car lots these days.

Most dealerships are very smart when it comes to the moment of signing. They invariably pick the very second your heart is beating wildly, your lips are smacking in anticipation, and your common sense is visiting in a neighboring state; then, and only then, will your salesman or finance manager stealthily slide the large mound of papers under your quivering hand and say, “Sign here, and here, and here.” We told you about the “fanning” of documents earlier. Though the routine may vary a bit, we also told you that the first two documents you will be asked to sign are usually the most disquieting. • The first sheet normally states, “I have read all of the documents put before me very carefully before I signed them.” Don’t you think that’s an interesting document to put in front of you before you sign anything? • The next document says, in effect, “I agree that the dealership may have made mistakes on these papers. I also agree that, even though the dealership has told me I am financed, they could be telling a little white lie. So I agree that none of this paperwork means anything if the dealership wants to change its mind. I’ll be glad to pay more.” That’s the fabled “yo-yo” technique (read all about it on page 100.) Stay away from these problems by shocking the dealership and carefully paying attention to every document you’re asked to sign. Here are some tips on what to pay attention to on some key documents: 1. The buyer’s order. This is the conditional sales contract you sign before you actually sign the finance contract. A buyer’s order shouldn’t be a scratched-up piece of paper; it should be a clean, neat sheet of paper with every important piece of information filled in. Look at those figures to make sure they are the figures you’ve agreed to pay. Also, make sure the buyer’s order figures match those on the actual installment loan contract if you’re financing at a dealership. Though it sounds corny, and you’re in a hurry to drive off in your new wheels, carefully paying attention to this document can save you lots of grief down the road. Many customers have been taken because the major record of their sale was too scratched over and through to stand up in court. Remember, this is a contract. If you are not financing at the dealership, it is the only contract. If you are financing at the dealership, it is the only record containing important information about warranties and a few other tidbits. Make sure your buyer’s order contains the following information. Take this list with you to the dealership, if necessary. a. The date b. Year of cars (yours, too, if you’re trading) c. Make and model of cars d. Vehicle identification numbers (VINs) e. Asking price f. Trade allowance (if you’re trading) g. “Difference” figure (if you’re trading) h. Amount of your payoff i. Taxes j. Amount to be financed k. Other fees l. Complete warranty statement (if a used car, if no other warranty statement is provided) m. Number and amount of payments (if you are financing at the dealer) n. APR (if you are financing) 2. Mileage statement. You will be asked to sign a mileage statement for your trade-in. The statement should be completely filled out, including the mileage. Many salesmen will leave the mileage blank and happily inform you the figure will be filled out later. Say no. Your mileage statement makes you liable for the actual mileage on your trade. If you let the salesman leave this figure blank, a sneaky salesman or store could run the miles on your car back, enter the false figure, and sell the car. If the new buyer should discover this, you can be sued, not the dealer—because you signed it blank, dummy. The seller will also provide you a mileage statement on his car. If you are buying a new car, the mileage should obviously be low. It should also match the figure on the odometer. Again, insist that the statement be filled out completely. If you are buying a used car, the seller is obligated to give you a copy of a statement signed by the previous owner. If there is no mileage statement from the previous owner, don’t buy the car. Insist that copies of both mileage statements be given to you. 3. Powers of attorney. You will be required to sign “limited powers of attorney.” Normally, you will be asked to sign two of these: one for the car you are purchasing and one for the car you are trading. These powers of attorney simply give the seller the legal authority to change titles. If you have already signed the buyer’s order, it’s okay to sign the powers of attorney. Many dealerships must type these up to satisfy state law—but insist that they be filled out before you sign, especially if the people you are dealing with make you feel a little uneasy. 4. Finance contracts. All finance contracts, especially those used by dealers, will remind you of War and Peace. The back of every single page is just loaded with all types of unusual protection for the financing institution. For instance, most contracts say your car can be repossessed even if you pay your payments on time—the institution simply needs to feel that their loan is in jeopardy. Most of these contracts also state that your car cannot be driven or “domiciled” out of your state without the permission of the financing institution. Unfortunately, you can’t do much about all this fine print, but you do need to make sure the typed-in portions of the finance contract match the fiures and other entries on your buyer’s order.

“So it’s really difficult to write akathists?” I asked. “There’s enormous difficulty…” Ieronym wagged his head. “Wisdom and holiness won’t do anything here, if God doesn’t give you the gift. Monks who don’t understand about it reckon you only need to know the life of the saint you’re writing to, and then follow the other akathists. But that’s not right, sir. Of course, a man who writes an akathist has to know the life extremely well, to the last little point. Well, and also to follow the other akathists, how to begin and what to write about. To give you an example, the first kontakion begins every time with ‘the victorious’ or ‘the chosen’ … The first ikos always has to begin with angels. In the akathist to the Most Sweet Jesus, if you’re interested, it begins like this: ‘Creator of angels and lord of hosts,’ in the akathist to the Most Holy Mother of God: ‘An angel was sent from heaven to stand before,’ to Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker:5 ‘An angel in appearance, but of earthly nature,’ and so on. There’s always an angel at the beginning. Of course, you can’t do without following, but the main thing is not in the life, not in the correspondence with the others, but in the beauty and sweetness. It all has to be shapely, brief, and thorough. There should be softness, gentleness, and tenderness in every little line, so that there’s not a single coarse, harsh, or unsuitable word. It has to be written so that the one who is praying will rejoice and weep in his heart, but shake and be in awe in his mind. In the akathist to the Mother of God there are the words: ‘Rejoice, height unattainable to human reason; rejoice, depth invisible to the eyes of angels!’ In another place in the same akathist it says: ‘Rejoice, tree of the bright fruit on which the faithful feed, rejoice, tree of good-shading leaves in which many find shelter!’”

In the history of Russian pessimism, the general decrepitude of the university buildings, the gloomy corridors, the grimy walls, the inadequate light, the dismal look of the stairs, cloakrooms and benches, occupy one of the foremost places in the series of causes predisposing … And here is our garden. It seems to have become neither better nor worse since I was a student. I don’t like it. It would be much smarter if, instead of consumptive lindens, yellow acacias, and sparse trimmed lilacs, there were tall pines and handsome oaks growing here.

A slavish worship of authority and a lack of any need for independent thinking. To talk him out of anything is difficult, to argue with him is impossible. Try arguing with a person who is profoundly convinced that the best science is medicine, the best people are doctors, the best traditions are medical traditions. The nefarious past of medicine has survived only in one tradition—the white tie now worn by doctors; for the scientist and for the educated man in general, only university-wide traditions can exist, with no divisions into medical, legal, and so on, but Pyotr Ignatievich finds it hard to agree with that, and he is prepared to argue with you till doomsday

A good conductor, as he conveys a composer’s thought, does twenty things at once: reads the score, waves his baton, watches the singer, gestures now towards the drum, now towards the French horn, and so on. It is the same with me when I lecture. Before me are a hundred and fifty faces, no two alike, and three hundred eyes looking me straight in the face. My goal is to conquer this many-headed hydra. If, as I lecture, I have at every moment a clear notion of the degree of its attention and the power of its comprehension, then it is in my control. My other adversary sits inside myself. It is the infinite diversity of forms, phenomena, and laws, and the host of thoughts, my own and other people’s, that they call forth. At every moment I must be adroit enough to snatch what is most important and necessary from this vast material and, in pace with my speech, to clothe my thinking in such form as will be accessible to the hydra’s understanding and arouse its attention, and at the same time I must observe keenly that the thoughts are conveyed, not as they accumulate, but in a certain order necessary for the correct composition of the picture I wish to paint. Furthermore, I try to make my speech literary, my definitions brief and precise, my phrasing as simple and elegant as possible. At every moment I must rein myself in and remember that I have only an hour and forty minutes at my disposal. In short, it’s no little work. I have to figure at one and the same time as a scientist, a pedagogue, and an orator, and it’s a bad business if the orator in you overwhelms the pedagogue and scientist, or the other way round.

My conscience and intelligence tell me that the best thing I could do now is give the boys a farewell lecture, speak my last words to them, bless them, and yield my place to a man who is younger and stronger than I. But, God be my judge, I lack the courage to follow my conscience. Unfortunately, I’m not a philosopher and not a theologian. I know very well that I have no more than another six months to live; it would seem I should now be most occupied with questions about the darkness beyond the grave and the visions that will haunt my sepulchral sleep. But for some reason my soul rejects those questions, though my mind is aware of all their importance. As twenty or thirty years ago, so now in the face of death I am interested only in science. Breathing my last, I will still believe that science is the most important, the most beautiful and necessary thing in man’s life, that it has always been and always will be the highest manifestation of love, and that only by science will man conquer nature and himself. This faith may be naïve and incorrect in its foundations, but it is not my fault that I believe thus and not otherwise; in myself I cannot overcome this faith.

I’m not saying that French books are talented, and intelligent, and noble. They don’t satisfy me either. But they’re less boring than the Russian ones, and not seldom one finds in them the main element of creative work—a sense of personal freedom, which Russian authors don’t have. I can’t remember a single new book in which the author doesn’t do his best, from the very first page, to entangle himself in all possible conventions and private deals with his conscience. One is afraid to speak of the naked body, another is bound hand and foot by psychological analysis, a third must have “a warm attitude towards humanity,” a fourth purposely wallows for whole pages in descriptions of nature, lest he be suspected of tendentiousness … One insists on being a bourgeois in his work, another an aristocrat, etc. Contrivance, caution, keeping one’s own counsel, but no freedom nor courage to write as one wishes, and therefore no creativity.

I have very vivid memories of the Pacific crossing. We came across on a freighter when I was ten. I remember the power of the ocean and the seagulls. And four years later, when I first read Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, I was deeply moved by the poem that went “alone, alone, all, all alone, alone on a wide, wide sea, and never a saint took pity, on my soul in agony.” I remember reading those lines and immediately completely understanding, as much as a fourteen-year-old can, about being alone, about alienation. It was an immediate connection with my transpacific crossing.

I am deeply interested in what I call the marriage between my conscious and unconscious mind. The first time this happened so very dramatically was when I was working on my second string quartet—that puts it around, I guess, 1948 or ’49. I recall I was sitting and writing—actually in an attic, believe it or not. The intensity of concentration became so strong that I remember that the paper in front of me on the table became white, pure, blazing white. I seemed to be surrounded by pure, blazing white. I didn’t know what I was doing; my hand kept moving, but I couldn’t see it because I was blinded by this white light. All I recall is that I sat there, practically the whole night through, till I finally put the pencil down. The quartet was finished. I remember dropping into my bed in a complete state of exhaustion, and I slept, I believe, for twenty-four hours. When I finally got up, I seemed to recall—yeah, I did—what had happened. I walked over to my table, and there it was. And I began to read it, and I didn’t remember it; I didn’t remember writing it. But it was my handwriting, and there’s my pencil, so I must have done it. But I don’t remember it, at least not consciously. But it was good. Yes, this was good. And of course I then accepted it as my own. I have told my students over and over again that one has to learn—and this is a lifetime job—to accept one’s unconscious mind, that when there is a marriage between the conscious and the unconscious, you will reach the highest levels of creativity, and that it is as though you are not there, it is as though someone else, something else, name it what you wish, is doing it, not you. You don’t even exist at that particular moment. In retrospect all you remember is how wonderful, how positively magnificent it felt.

I tired of Buddhism, just as I tired of Christianity and Islam. It just got to the point where it no longer satisfied whatever it was I was tryin’ to do. See, Buddhism didn’t get broad enough either. Like all the other religions I’ve explored, it also had this dogma. At the bottom of every religion there always seems to linger this dogma. It may take time to see, but finally it comes through; sooner or later you’ll hear it: “We’re better than the others.” Oh, this dogma, it really turns me off. You know what I mean? Jonestown dogma: “You must do this.” I also found out later that when you take on another culture, you don’t have all the things that it takes for this culture because certain things that they have experienced you haven’t. Although there’s good parts of it that you can use, there’s also things that you cannot use.

They buy Gulfstream jets. They run programs like empowerment, leadership training, open-book management, and total-quality management. And they line-extend their brands.

Many companies run branding programs almost devoid of credentials. If you leaf through a stack of print ads or watch a series of television commercials, you’ll find an endless parade of almost meaningless benefits: Tastes great, saves money, whitens teeth, easy assembly, bigger, smaller, lighter, faster, cheaper. While many of these benefits may be of general interest to prospective customers, they each lack credibility so they are generally ignored. “That’s what they all say.” When the benefits, however, are structured around some aspect of a brand’s credentials, they carry much more weight.

There are also the long-term benefits of leadership. Because once you get on top, it’s hard to lose your spot. A widely publicized study of twenty-five leading brands in twenty-five different product categories in the year 1923 showed that twenty of the same twenty-five brands are still the leaders in their categories today. In seventy-five years only five brands lost their leadership. Never assume that people know which brand is the leader. This is especially true in fast-growing, new categories like contact software and maintenance software. Most new prospects have no experience with the category and little knowledge of available brands, so they naturally gravitate to the leading brand.

The no-good product is the red herring of marketing. It is constantly being used to justify the no-brand strategies of most companies. We don’t mean literally a no-brand strategy. A company might own brands that might be called brands from a legal point of view in the sense that their names are registered trademarks. But the company’s strategies are based on building the better product or service, and the brand names it uses to accompany these products have little power in the prospect’s mind.

Witness the shift from generic (or general) names to specific names: Nabisco, Alcoa, NBC, GE, ABC, IBM. There are many national biscuit companies, but only one Nabisco. There are many aluminum companies in America, but only one Alcoa. There are many national broadcasting companies, but only one NBC. Of course, we’re sure that NBC always considered itself the National Broadcasting Company rather than a “national broadcasting company.” And therein lies the biggest mistake made when picking brand names. The process proceeds visually rather than verbally. Executives often pass around the boardroom logotypes of prospective brand names, set in type and mounted on foamcore. But the vast majority of brand communication takes place verbally, not visually. The average person spends nine times as much time listening to radio and television than he or she does reading magazines and newspapers.

Nobody is saying that you should always invent a new name for an established brand, although that’s often a good strategy for a product or service that is truly revolutionary and unlikely to be copied for some time. Kodak and Xerox are the usual suspects. What you should generally do is take a regular word and use it out of context to connote the primary attribute of your brand. Blockbuster Video is a powerful brand name. General Video Rental is not. Hollywood brags about its “blockbusters,” so Blockbuster Video borrowed the term to suggest it rents the best movies. Budget is a powerful brand name for a car-rental service. The word suggests that it rents cars at low prices. Low-Cost Car Rental is not a good brand name.

Furthermore, there is often interest in the trade (which includes retailers and distributors) about the company behind a brand. For example, whom do we order Tide from? For many brands one answer is to put the company name in small type above the brand name. Customers who are strongly motivated to use only the brand name will hardly notice the company name. Yet the trade and today’s more sophisticated customers will be able to easily find the name of the company behind the brand.

Yet, in some situations, a family of brands can be developed that will assure a company’s control of a market for many decades to come. Take the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company. For more than a hundred years, Wrigley has dominated the chewing gum market, generating billions of dollars of profits. But not with one brand. Today Wrigley has a family of brands. Big Red (a cinnamon-flavored brand) Doublemint (a peppermint-flavored brand) Extra (a sugar-free brand) Freedent (a stick-free brand) Juicy Fruit (a fruit-flavored brand) Spearmint (a spearmint-flavored brand) Winterfresh (a breath-freshener brand)

The Wrigley approach is not perfect. Wrigley’s first three brands (Juicy Fruit, Spearmint, and Doublemint) are too much like line extensions. They need the Wrigley name to support their generic brand names. Big Red, Extra, Freedent, and Winterfresh, however, can stand on their own, each as totally separate brands. Most managers are too internally focused to see the power of a separate identity. They want to “take advantage of the equity” their brand already owns in the mind in order to successfully launch a new brand.

Nor is there a need to tag the corporate identity on every brand. Does the customer buy a Lexus because it’s made by Toyota? Or in spite of the fact that it’s made by Toyota? The customer buys a Lexus. That’s the power of the Lexus brand. The corporate connection is irrelevant. In particular, corporate management should keep the following principles in mind when selecting a sibling strategy for its stable of brands. Focus on a common product area. Passenger cars, chewing gum, over-the-counter drugs, these are some common product areas around which to build a sibling portfolio. Select a single attribute to segment. Price is the most common, but other attributes include distribution, age, calories, sex, flavors. By segmenting a single attribute only, you reduce the potential confusion between your brands. What you want to avoid is any overlap among brands. Keep each brand unique and special. Set up rigid distinctions among brands. Price is the easiest attribute to segment because you can put specific numbers on each brand. When prices overlap, it’s very difficult to keep the brands separate. Most car owners confused Oldsmobile and Buick because their price ranges were quite similar. Create different, not similar brand names. You don’t want to create a family of brands, you want to create a family of different brands. Look at some of Chevrolet’s model names: Cavalier, Camaro, Corsica, Caprice, Corvette. (Recently they dropped Corsica and Caprice, but those “C” names are still confusing.)     One reason these model names can’t be brands is the fact that they are too similar. If Chevrolet wanted to create brands instead of model names, it should have used distinctive names. Alliteration is the curse of a sibling family. Launch a new sibling only when you can create a new category. New brands should not be launched just to fill a hole in the line or to compete directly with an existing competitor. This principle is the one most often violated by even the largest of companies. Coca-Cola launched Mr. Pibb, not to create a new category, but to block the growth of Dr Pepper. Coca-Cola launched Fruitopia, not to create a new category, but to block the growth of Snapple. Then they launched Mello Yello to block the growth of Mountain Dew. That didn’t work, so they launched Surge, which didn’t work either. All four brands have gone nowhere. Keep control of the sibling family at the highest level. If you don’t, you will find that your powerful, distinctive brands will slowly fall apart. They will become victims of sibling rivalry, a pattern of corporate behavior that depends upon copying the best features of a brand’s sibling competitors. You’ll end up like General Motors with a family of brands that all look alike. A family of sibling brands is not a strategy for every corporation. But where it is appropriate, a sibling strategy can be used to dominate a category over the long term.

Another way to make a brand distinctive is with color. But color is not an easy attribute to work with. There are thousands of words to choose from in order to create a unique name, but only a handful of colors. There are five basic colors (red, orange, yellow, green, and blue) plus the neutral colors (black, white, and gray). It’s best to stick to one of these five primary colors rather than an intermediate or mixed color. But which color? Keep in mind that all colors are not created equal in the eye of the beholder. Colors on the red end of the spectrum are focused slightly behind the retinas in your eyes. Therefore, a red color appears to move toward your eyes while you’re looking at it.

When selecting a color for a brand or a logo, managers usually focus on the mood they want to establish rather than the unique identity they want to create. And while mood or tone can be important, other factors should override a choice based on mood alone. Leaders have first choice. Normally the best color to select is the one that is most symbolic of the category. John Deere is the leading brand of farm tractor. Does it surprise you that John Deere picked green, the color of grass, trees, and agriculture, as the brand’s signature color?

While a single color is almost always the best color strategy for a brand, sometimes you can make a case for multiple colors. Federal Express, the first overnight-package-delivery company, wanted its packages to stand out on the recipient’s desk. So it combined the two most shocking colors it could find: orange and purple. When a FedEx package arrives, everybody can see that a FedEx package has arrived. It’s like an orange-and-purple suit in a sea of corporate blue. Color consistency over the long term can help a brand burn its way into the mind. Look at what yellow has done for Caterpillar, brown for United Parcel Service, red for Coca-Cola, the green jacket for the Masters golf tournament, and blue for IBM. What blue did for Big Blue, a unique color can do for your big brand.

Talking about the seriousness of life, as we are, in some respects recalls to my mind a section that comes from Poe’s “Masque of the Red Death,” and it goes as follows: “There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless that cannot be touched without emotion, even with the utterly lost to whom life and death are equally jest, there are some things about which no jest can be made.” That struck me as a young boy, and I still have not gotten over the import of it. I think that’s true. I’ve known, from time to time in my life, people who were rather desperate, but unless they were absolutely mad, there were some things about which they could make no jest; there were some things of great and full importance in their lives that they could not mock and could not put away to contemplate on some other day.

As I think about those things of which I cannot jest, I’ve tried to simplify through my life. I think when I was a young man I was much in pursuit of philosophy and meaning and a vision of the world as it is truly related, and probably somewhere along the way, when I moved out of that theoretical realm, I came to realize that no such complete vision is vouchsafed to men and women in their lifetimes; that if there is a great unity out there in this universe, that we apprehend it only by very subjective means, and that I would never see it in any concretized fashion. Therefore one must do the best one can, and I think that with the passage of time that you learn that love has meaning, and part of the meaning is that you work to preserve it and work to earn it and to deserve it. And I believe that the fellow that wakes up in the morning and is not struck by some sense of wonderment at the world that he sees, whether it be reflected in the eyes of his family or in nature itself, is all through. He then becomes an automaton, a person not much elevated from these admirable animals we see in the air and on the ground and in the seas.

“This is a misunderstanding, of course …” he thought, looking at the crimson windows. “Fifteen hundred, two thousand factory hands work without rest, in unhealthy conditions, producing poor-quality calico, starving, and only occasionally sobering up from this nightmare in a pothouse; a hundred men supervise the work, and the whole life of those hundred men goes into levying fines, pouring out abuse, being unjust, and only the two or three so-called owners enjoy the profits, though they don’t work at all and scorn poor-quality calico. But what profits, and how do they enjoy them? Mrs. Lialikov and her daughter are unhappy, it’s a pity to look at them, only Christina Dmitrievna, a rather stupid old maid in a pince-nez, lives to her full satisfaction. And so it turns out that all five of these buildings work, and poor-quality calico is sold on the Eastern markets, only so that Christina Dmitrievna can eat sterlet and drink Madeira.”

And he knew what to tell her. It was clear to him that she ought quickly to leave those five buildings and the million, if she had it, to leave that devil who watched at night; it was also clear to him that she herself thought so, too, and was only waiting for someone she trusted to confirm it. But he did not know how to say it. How? It was mortifying to ask condemned people what they were condemned for; just as it was awkward to ask very rich people what they needed so much money for, why they disposed of their wealth so badly, why they would not abandon it, even when they could see it was to their own misfortune; and if such a conversation began, it usually turned out to be embarrassing, awkward, long.

“How to say it?” pondered Korolev. “And need I say it?” And he said what he wanted to say, not directly, but in a roundabout way: “You’re not content in your position as a factory owner and a rich heiress, you don’t believe in your right to it, and now you can’t sleep, which, of course, is certainly better than if you were content, slept soundly, and thought everything was fine. Your insomnia is respectable; in any event, it’s a good sign. In fact, for our parents such a conversation as we’re having now would have been unthinkable; they didn’t talk at night, they slept soundly, but we, our generation, sleep badly, are anguished, talk a lot, and keep trying to decide if we’re right or not. But for our children or grandchildren this question—whether they’re right or not—will be decided. They’ll see better than we do. Life will be good in fifty years or so, it’s only a pity we won’t make it that far. It would be interesting to have a look.”

Next morning, when the carriage drove up, everybody came out on the porch to see him off.

He lay down and began to fall asleep; and suddenly they were walking together and singing again: “We walk, walk, walk … We take what’s hardest and bitterest from life, and leave you what’s easy and joyful, and you, sitting over your supper, can reason coolly and soberly about why we suffer and perish, and why we’re not as healthy and contented as you.” What they sang had occurred to him before, but this thought had somehow sat behind other thoughts in his head and flashed timidly, like a distant lantern in misty weather. And he felt that this suicide and the peasant’s grievances lay on his conscience, too; to be reconciled with the fact that these people, submissive to their lot, heaped on themselves what was heaviest and darkest in life—how terrible it was! To be reconciled with that, and to wish for oneself a bright, boisterous life among happy, contented people, and to dream constantly of such a life, meant to dream of new suicides by overworked, careworn people, or by weak, neglected people, whom one sometimes talked about with vexation or mockery over dinner, but whom one did not go to help … And again:

Repeated experience, and bitter experience indeed, had long since taught him that every intimacy, which in the beginning lends life such pleasant diversity and presents itself as a nice and light adventure, inevitably, with decent people—especially irresolute Muscovites, who are slow starters—grows into a major task, extremely complicated, and the situation finally becomes burdensome. But at every new meeting with an interesting woman, this experience somehow slipped from his memory, and he wanted to live, and everything seemed quite simple and amusing.

The train left quickly, its lights soon disappeared, and a moment later the noise could no longer be heard, as if everything were conspiring on purpose to put a speedy end to this sweet oblivion, this madness. And, left alone on the platform and gazing into the dark distance, Gurov listened to the chirring of the grasshoppers and the hum of the telegraph wires with a feeling as if he had just woken up. And he thought that now there was one more affair or adventure in his life, and it, too, was now over, and all that was left was the memory … He was touched, saddened, and felt some slight remorse; this young woman whom he was never to see again had not been happy with him; he had been affectionate with her, and sincere, but all the same, in his treatment of her, in his tone and caresses, there had been a slight shade of mockery, the somewhat coarse arrogance of a happy man, who was, moreover, almost twice her age. She had all the while called him kind, extraordinary, lofty; obviously, he had appeared to her not as he was in reality, and therefore he had involuntarily deceived her …

One night, as he was leaving the Doctors’ Club together with his partner, an official, he could not help himself and said: “If you only knew what a charming woman I met in Yalta!” The official got into a sleigh and drove off, but suddenly turned around and called out: “Dmitri Dmitrich!” “What?” “You were right earlier: the sturgeon was a bit off!” Those words, so very ordinary, for some reason suddenly made Gurov indignant, struck him as humiliating, impure. Such savage manners, such faces! These senseless nights, and such uninteresting, unremarkable days! Frenzied card-playing, gluttony, drunkenness, constant talk about the same thing. Useless matters and conversations about the same thing took for their share the best part of one’s time, the best of one’s powers, and what was left in the end was some sort of curtailed, wingless life, some sort of nonsense, and it was impossible to get away or flee, as if you were sitting in a madhouse or a prison camp!

At the entrance to the grove stood a boundary post. Yelizarov touched it to see if it was sturdy. Praskovya came up, out of breath. Her wrinkled, perpetually frightened face was radiant with happiness: she had been in church today, like other people, then had gone to the fair, and there she had drunk pear kvass! That rarely happened to her, and it even seemed to her now that she had lived for her own pleasure for the first time in her life. After resting, all three went on together. The sun was setting, and its rays penetrated the grove, shone on the tree trunks. Loud voices rang out ahead.

Nevertheless, such determined efforts to scorn visual experience have always been matched by equally persistent attempts to mould the material world to graceful ends. People have strained their backs carving flowers into their roof beams and their eyesight embroidering animals onto their tablecloths. They have given up weekends to hide unsightly cables behind ledges. They have thought carefully about appropriate kitchen work-surfaces. They have imagined living in unattainably expensive houses pictured in magazines and then felt sad, as one does on passing an attractive stranger in a crowded street.

However, after coming up against some of the sterner setbacks which bedevil emotional and political life, we may well arrive at a more charitable assessment of the significance of beauty — of islands of perfection, in which we can find an echo of an ideal which we once hoped to lay a permanent claim to. Life may have to show itself to us in some of its authentically tragic colours before we can begin to grow properly visually responsive to its subtler offerings, whether in the form of a tapestry or a Corinthian column, a slate tile or a lamp. It tends not to be young couples in love who stop to admire a weathered brick wall or the descent of a banister towards a hallway, a disregard for such circumscribed beauty being a corollary of an optimistic belief in the possibility of attaining a more visceral, definitive variety of happiness.

We may need to have made an indelible mark on our lives, to have married the wrong person, pursued an unfulfilling career into middle age or lost a loved one before architecture can begin to have any perceptible impact on us, for when we speak of being ‘moved’ by a building, we allude to a bitter-sweet feeling of contrast between the noble qualities written into a structure and the sadder wider reality within which we know them to exist. A lump rises in our throat at the sight of beauty from an implicit knowledge that the happiness it hints at is the exception.

In his memoirs, the German theologian Paul Tillich explained that art had always left him cold as a pampered and trouble-free young man, despite the best pedagogical efforts of his parents and teachers. Then the First World War broke out, he was called up and, in a period of leave from his battalion (three quarters of whose members would be killed in the course of the conflict), he found himself in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin during a rain storm. There, in a small upper gallery, he came across Sandro Botticelli's Madonna and Child with Eight Singing Angels and, on meeting the wise, fragile, compassionate gaze of the Virgin, surprised himself by beginning to sob uncontrollably. He experienced what he described as a moment of'revelatory ecstasy', tears welling up in his eyes at the disjunction between the exceptionally tender atmosphere of the picture and the barbarous lessons he had learnt in the trenches.

When it came to simpler, cheaper houses, there was again a consensus about the most fitting way to build, though here the canon was the result not of any common cultural vision but of a host of limitations. Foremost among these was climate, which, in the absence of affordable technology to resist it, usually dictated an austere menu of options for how most sensibly to put up a wall, pitch a roof or render a faâade. The expense of transporting materials over any significant distance likewise limited stylistic choice, forcing the majority of householders to settle uncomplainingly for available stone, wood or mud. The difficulties of travel also hindered the spread of knowledge about alternative building methods. Printing costs meant that few ever saw so much as a picture of how houses looked in other parts of the world (which explains why, in so much of early northern religious art, Jesus is born in what appears to be a chalet).

In essence, what works of design and architecture talk to us about is the kind of life that would most appropriately unfold within and around them. They tell us of certain moods that they seek to encourage and sustain in their inhabitants. While keeping us warm and helping us in mechanical ways, they simultaneously hold out an invitation for us to be specific sorts of people. They speak of visions of happiness.

To describe a building as beautiful therefore suggests more than a mere aesthetic fondness; it implies an attraction to the particular way of life this structure is promoting through its roof, door handles, window frames, staircase and furnishings. A feeling of beauty is a sign that we have come upon a material articulation of certain of our ideas of a good life.

In general the doctrine of the Superman can only be understood correctly in conjunction with other ideas of the author's, such as:—the Order of Rank, the Will to Power, and the Transvaluation of all Values. He assumes that Christianity, as a product of the resentment of the botched and the weak, has put in ban all that is beautiful, strong, proud, and powerful, in fact all the qualities resulting from strength, and that, in consequence, all forces which tend to promote or elevate life have been seriously undermined.

His friends caused him many disappointments, which were the more bitter to him, inasmuch as he regarded friendship as such a sacred institution; and for the first time in his life he realised the whole horror of that loneliness to which, perhaps, all greatness is condemned. But to be forsaken is something very different from deliberately choosing blessed loneliness. How he longed, in those days, for the ideal friend who would thoroughly understand him, to whom he would be able to say all, and whom he imagined he had found at various periods in his life from his earliest youth onwards. Now, however, that the way he had chosen grew ever more perilous and steep, he found nobody who could follow him: he therefore created a perfect friend for himself in the ideal form of a majestic philosopher, and made this creation the preacher of his gospel to the world.

With the exception of the ten days occupied in composing the first part of this book, my brother often referred to this winter as the hardest and sickliest he had ever experienced. He did not, however, mean thereby that his former disorders were troubling him, but that he was suffering from a severe attack of influenza which he had caught in Santa Margherita, and which tormented him for several weeks after his arrival in Genoa. As a matter of fact, however, what he complained of most was his spiritual condition—that indescribable forsakenness—to which he gives such heartrending expression in "Zarathustra". Even the reception which the first part met with at the hands of friends and acquaintances was extremely disheartening: for almost all those to whom he presented copies of the work misunderstood it. "I found no one ripe for many of my thoughts; the case of 'Zarathustra' proves that one can speak with the utmost clearness, and yet not be heard by any one."

"—Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration? If not, I will describe it. If one had the smallest vestige of superstition in one, it would hardly be possible to set aside completely the idea that one is the mere incarnation, mouthpiece or medium of an almighty power. The idea of revelation in the sense that something becomes suddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy, which profoundly convulses and upsets one—describes simply the matter of fact. One hears—one does not seek; one takes—one does not ask who gives: a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning, it comes with necessity, unhesitatingly—I have never had any choice in the matter. There is an ecstasy such that the immense strain of it is sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears, along with which one's steps either rush or involuntarily lag, alternately. There is the feeling that one is completely out of hand, with the very distinct consciousness of an endless number of fine thrills and quiverings to the very toes;—there is a depth of happiness in which the painfullest and gloomiest do not operate as antitheses, but as conditioned, as demanded in the sense of necessary shades of colour in such an overflow of light. There is an instinct for rhythmic relations which embraces wide areas of forms (length, the need of a wide-embracing rhythm, is almost the measure of the force of an inspiration, a sort of counterpart to its pressure and tension). Everything happens quite involuntarily, as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom, of absoluteness, of power and divinity. The involuntariness of the figures and similes is the most remarkable thing; one loses all perception of what constitutes the figure and what constitutes the simile; everything seems to present itself as the readiest, the correctest and the simplest means of expression. It actually seems, to use one of Zarathustra's own phrases, as if all things came unto one, and would fain be similes: 'Here do all things come caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee, for they want to ride upon thy back. On every simile dost thou here ride to every truth. Here fly open unto thee all being's words and word-cabinets; here all being wanteth to become words, here all becoming wanteth to learn of thee how to talk.' This is MY experience of inspiration. I do not doubt but that one would have to go back thousands of years in order to find some one who could say to me: It is mine also!—"
