Every skill has what I call a frustration barrier—a period of time in which you’re horribly unskilled, and you’re painfully aware of that fact.

It’s important to note that some skills have safety considerations, which you should always include in your target performance level. Getting hurt (or killed) acquiring a new skill defeats the purpose.

This is what's wrong with programming education. Learning bubble sort and other stuff that's not often used is important for several reasons. We just have to make the student understand that reason.

This is nother thing that we have to correct. The student should understand that even though what he's writing may not he useful it instills in him some basic concept that will be very useful later on.

This model of exercise can be *very* useful to new comers. Expressing parts of our daily lives in pseudocode would make it easier for people to better understand how programming works

Here’s a fun way of trying this yourself. Find a friend, and ask them to help you complete a simple task like “make a sandwich.” The only rule is that your friend can only do exactly what you tell him, nothing more, nothing less. He is not allowed to assume knowledge of anything, and has to take every request literally.

Once you get used to the fact that the computer can’t read your mind, you learn to start giving commands the system can understand, in the same way you learned to explicitly define terms and demonstrate basic actions to your friend in the “Sandwich Game” before giving complex commands.
