I can understand this notion, while I think every little word adds great melodies to Proust's long sentences, publishers need to worry about more than that. Even so, with just the first volume, it should have been printed right away. I think Proust's real value isn't in his storytelling, even without knowing where the story will go, his characters embody everything that make us human. That alone is enough.

“At the end of seven hundred and twelve pages of this manuscript,” he had reported, “after innumerable griefs at being drowned in unfathomable developments and irritating impatience at never being able to rise to the surface—one doesn’t have a single, but not a single clue of what this is about. What is the point of all this? What does it all mean? Where is it all leading? Impossible to know anything about it! Impossible to say anything about it!”

However unusual the attempt to compress seven volumes of a novel into fifteen seconds, perhaps nothing exceeds, in both regularity and scope, the compression entailed by a daily newspaper. Stories that would comfortably fill twenty volumes find themselves reduced to narrow columns, competing for the reader’s attention with a multitude of once profound, now etiolated dramas.

He read newspapers with great care. He wouldn’t even overlook the news-in-brief section. A news-in-brief told by him turned into a whole tragic or comic novel, thanks to his imagination and his fantasy.

No need to be such a snob, we all do it, for better or for worse. It is not so unfathomable that Proust also felt the need to please others in such ways.

These literary quotations were not simply designed to impress (though Proust did happen to feel that “one must never miss an opportunity of quoting things by others which are always more interesting than those one thinks up oneself”).

So true... This reminds me of his description of the new laziness where the usual emptiness is replaced with activities so that people don't feel bored. Result is the same. The illusion of being busy is meant to comfort ourselves. We almost always have the time for the things we really care about.

And if there is no time, at least to resist the approach of Alfred Humblot at Ollendorf and Jacques Madeleine at Fasquelle, which Proust defined as “the self-satisfaction felt by ‘busy’ men—however idiotic their business—at ‘not having time’ to do what you are doing.”

Lucien Daudet tells us that Proust had a friend who thought it chic to use English expressions when he was speaking French, and would therefore say “Good-bye” or, more casually, “Bye, bye” whenever he left a room.

So true. We have come to refuse gifts from those closest to us because we think we show them that we care only for their self, with or without gifts, becuse we don't want to inconvenience them. How painful it is to hear these excuses and more, when all we wanted was to express our love.

The incident emphasizes once more that beauty is something to be found, rather than passively encountered, that it requires us to pick up on certain details, to identify the whiteness of a cotton dress, the reflection of the sea on the hull of a yacht, or the contrast between the color of a jockey’s coat and his face.

I wonder if it is this need to liken others to people we (or others) have deemed to be intelligent, charming etc. before we can accept that they are indeed inteligent that pushes so many people to imitate those they lredy deem to be intelligent. Is this why people got up at the end of concerts and shout "Bravo!", because the conductor or the performers have alredy been accepted as more intelligent, more knowledgeable beings than themselves?

Similarly, there are people who are doubtful whether someone is intelligent, but who rapidly become convinced that they are once they see them fit the dominant image of an intelligent person and learn of their formal education, factual knowledge, and university degree.

This isn’t to propose an equally, if more perversely, snobbish argument that education has no value, and that the importance of European history from Campo Formio to the battle of Waterloo is the result of a sinister academic conspiracy, but rather that an ability to identify emperors and spell aproximately is not in itself enough to establish the existence of something as hard to define as intelligence.

Exact same thing happened with computers recently. People used to be in awe of computers, dreaming of owning one. These days we are busy chasing phones capable of much more processing power, only to forget that it is a marvel that we hold in our hands in a couple of days.

A mere thirty-one years separated Bell’s invention from Proust’s sad observations on the state of French telephone-appreciation. It had taken a little more than three decades for a technological marvel to cease attracting admiring glances and turn into a household object that we wouldn’t hesitate to condemn were we to suffer at its hands the minor inconvenience of a delayed glace au chocolat.

Most people have taken this to an extreme. Almost everyone has become children sitting in front of a TV, getting delighted when a new ad is shown, getting painfully bored when something they have already seen is shown. This is why idiotic things like TED have become so popular. This is also why, I believe, prompted my cousin to question my mental abilities when I told her that I enjoy reading the same books over and over again, or watching the same movies/TV series over and over.

But once the recipe had yielded a delicious dessert, in between mouthfuls of Françoise’s chocolate mousse we might pause to ask whether this dish, and by extension the entire volume of La Cuisine retrouvée, really constituted an homage to Proust, or whether it was not in danger of encouraging the very sin he had warned his readers about—artistic idolatry.
